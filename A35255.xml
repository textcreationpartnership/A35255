            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis ≈ømall Volume is intended for the u≈øe of tho≈øe who cannot go to the price of a greater, and yet would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be informed of tho≈øe wonderful Tran≈øactions and Revolutions which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the≈øe Three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in this la≈øt Age, and within the memory of many now living: And though it cannot be expected that a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of every particular <hi>Accident</hi> can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this little <hi>Compendium,</hi> yet I have endeavoured, without the lea≈øt pa≈ø≈øion or partiality, briefly to compri≈øe the mo≈øt con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>Matters.</hi>

            <head>THE WARS IN <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEfore we proceed to give an Account of tho≈øe Unnatural Wars, Ruins, and Deva≈øtations, which have happened in the≈øe Kingdoms in this La≈øt Age, it may ≈øeem nece≈ø≈øary, by way of Introduction, to give a Relation of ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral previous Tran≈øactions before the≈øe Woful Calamities befel us.</p>
            <p>Upon the 27th. day of <hi>March,</hi> in the year 1625, King <hi>James</hi> departed this life at <hi>Theobalds</hi> in the Fifty ninth year of his Age, when he had reigned Twenty two years compleat: And in the Afternoon of the ≈øame day <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> his only Son then living, was proclaimed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66116:4"/>King of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fir≈øt thing he did, was performing the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of his Fathers Funeral, in which the King him≈øelf in Per≈øon followed as chief Mourner immediately after the Her≈øe; having his Train of black Velvetborn up by the Twelve Peers of the Realm; at his right hand the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and at his left the Earl of <hi>Pembroke.</hi> He then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his Coronation, and after that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øummated the Marriage with <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> younger Daughter of the Great <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>France,</hi> whom he had formerly ≈øeen in his Journey through that Countrey into <hi>Spain;</hi> his fir≈øt Complement to her, when he went to meet her at <hi>Dover,</hi> was, <hi>That he de≈øired to be no longer Ma≈øter of him≈øelf, then he was Servant to her,</hi> which indeed he made good: for on the day before his deplorable death, he de≈øired his Daughter, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to a≈ø≈øure her Mother, if ever he ≈øaw her again, <hi>That his Thoughts had never ≈øtrayed from her, and that his Affections ≈øhould be the ≈øame to the la≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King then called a Parliament, which A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembled the Eighteenth of <hi>June</hi> follwoing, to whom he repre≈øented in a ≈øhort Speech, <q>The ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent nece≈ø≈øity of rai≈øing a Sub≈øidy, ≈øince it would not agree with his Kingly honour to ≈øhrink from the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which his Father upon ≈øolid Con≈øiderations had by con≈øent of both Hou≈øes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; although prevented by death from putting it in Execution: That Money, the ≈øinews of War mu≈øt be levied, without which neither Army nor Fleet could move; former Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being already disbur≈øed to a penny: That he ≈øhould ≈øeem ridiculous to all <hi>Europe,</hi> if he did not now at length proceed to Action: That it was his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66116:4"/>fir≈øt Enterprize, the ≈øucce≈øs whereof would have influence upon his following Reign: That it concerned their own Reputations herein to A≈ø≈øi≈øt him effectually, lea≈øt the world ≈øhould judge them to have betray'd their King: That Celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was nece≈ø≈øary becau≈øe of Winter then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, a ≈øea≈øon prejudicial to Martial At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: the Pe≈øtilence at that time Reigning in the City, which in all probability might cau≈øe a ≈øudden Di≈ø≈øolution of their Meeting: All which Arguments, if duly con≈øidered, did evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate, That it was mo≈øt Honourable, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune and ≈øafe, to u≈øe Expedition in the bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. As for Religion and Manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was re≈øolved to tread in his Fathers ≈øteps, hoping that his former life had mini≈øtred, no ju≈øt grounds for them to ≈øu≈øpect the contrary.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament acknowledged the≈øe Arguments for a Sub≈øidy to be very rational, but yet would not ≈øuddenly re≈øolve upon it, till they had fir≈øt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented their two Petitions, concerning Bea≈øons of Religion and Complaint of their Sufferings, which points had been offered to his Father King <hi>James,</hi> in the clo≈øe of his la≈øt Parliament, and by his death were left hitherto unan≈øwered.</p>
            <p>In both which they received competent ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and likewi≈øe an account of the Arrears which were due to the Forces both by Sea and Land, together with an E≈øtimate of the future Charge and Expence of the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> War; upon which the King obtained of the Laity freely and ab≈øolutely, Two Sub≈øidies to be paid by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants, and four from Papi≈øts; and three Sub≈øidies, from the Clergy. In this Parliament Dr. <hi>Montague</hi> the Kings Chaplain was que≈øtioned for certain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in his An≈øwer to a Book called the <hi>Romi≈øh Gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>

            <p>Divers Laws were Enacted in this Parliament, as one <hi>about Ob≈øervation of the Lord's day;</hi> another <hi>for re≈øtraint of Tipling in Inns, Alehou≈øes,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>During the fitting of the Parliament, the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> a Papi≈øt, and his Wife a Prote≈øtant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both de≈øirous of each others Conver≈øion, they put their cau≈øe upon a di≈øpute between <hi>James U≈øher</hi> L.

            <p>On the Eleventh of <hi>July,</hi> 1626, the Parliament by rea≈øon of the ≈øickne≈øs, Adjourned till <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> 1. and then met again at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the King fir≈øt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66116:5"/>by him≈øelf, and next by his two Secretaries, the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> and Sir <hi>John Cook,</hi> declared to them the nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øetting forth a Fleet, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which was the Countrey of the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhyns,</hi> who married the Kings Si≈øter, and was then unju≈øtly detained from him by the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Lord Trea≈øurer likewi≈øe in≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ≈øeveral Sums of Money, which King <hi>James</hi> died indebted to the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This occa≈øioned very warm Debates in the Hou≈øe of Commons, who alledged, <hi>That evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels guided the Kings De≈øigns; That the Trea≈øury was mi≈øimployed, That our nece≈ø≈øties aro≈øe through Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: That it would be nece≈ø≈øary to Petition the King for a stricter hand and better Councel to manage his Affairs: That though a former Parliament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the King in a War, yet if things were managed with Contrary de≈øigns; and the Trea≈øure mi≈øimployed, this Parliament was not bound to be carried blind≈øold in De≈øigns, not guided by ≈øound Council: That it was not u≈øual to grant Sub≈øidies upon Sub≈øidies in one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and no Grievances redne≈ø≈øed.</hi> With ≈øeveral other Pa≈ø≈øages of the like Nature.</p>
            <p>They likewi≈øe very much reflected upon the mi≈øcarriages of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> who was then a per≈øon of very con≈øiderable Tru≈øt: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they promi≈øed to con≈øider of the Kings de≈øires, and pre≈øented him a Petition again≈øt <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øants, giving an Account of their damage, a≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain Cau≈øes of their growth, and offering di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Remedies thereunto; unto which a ≈øatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry An≈øwer (if any thing would have ≈øatisfied) was returned: And hereupon there followed a Debate about Supplies; ≈øome were for contributing pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, others demurr'd, as di≈øliking the de≈øign in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66116:6"/>hand; and in conclu≈øion the Major part agreed not to give: And being incen≈øed again≈øt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> they began to think of dive≈øting him of his Offices, and to require an Account of the Publick Moneys wherewith he had been intru≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all which they intended to include in an humble Remon≈øtrance: to prevent which, the King re≈øolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Di≈ø≈øolve the Parliament; and accordingly the U≈øher of the Black Rod was ≈øent from the Hou≈øe of Lords to the Commons, who were then re≈øolved into a Grand Committee; and under≈øtanding the Kings plea≈øure, they cau≈øed the Speaker to keep his Seat, while they agreed upon a Me≈ø≈øage of Thanks to his Maje≈øty for his Gracious An≈øwer to their Petition for Religion, and for his care of their Health, in giving them leave to depart this dangerous time of Sickne≈øs; with a dutiful Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Affection and Loyalty, and of their purpo≈øing to ≈øupply him in a Parliamentary way, in fit and convenient time: After which they were accordingly di≈ø≈øolved.</p>
            <p>Now the War with <hi>Spain</hi> being intended both for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and to prevent di≈øturbance in our Civil E≈øtate, the Councel here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon re≈øolve with all ≈øpeed to ≈øet forth a Fleet, and to pre≈øerve ≈øtrict Unity and Peace with <hi>France, Denmark,</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> the King had already entered into a League Offen≈øive and Defen≈øive again≈øt the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria,</hi> and likewi≈øe had promi≈øed to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them in ≈øoliciting other Princes to enter into the ≈øame Confederation, upon Condition that they ≈øhould bear a Fourth part of the Charge of the Fleet; and in pur≈øuance hereof, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> were ≈øent to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and there meeting with the Amba≈ø≈øadors of <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66116:6"/>and <hi>Denmark,</hi> they concluded a League for re≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Liberties of <hi>Germany;</hi> the two la≈øt Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadors having no further power from their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteams.</p>
            <p>A while after the Di≈ø≈øolution of the Parliament, the King publi≈øhed a Proclamation, Commanding the return of all Children of Noble-men, which had been ≈øent to be Educated in <hi>Seminaries</hi> and <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Schools beyond Sea; that none who had received Orders from <hi>Rome,</hi> ≈øhould pre≈øume to confer Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or Exerci≈øe Eccle≈øia≈øtical Functions in any of his Dominions; and likewi≈øe that the Statute be put in Execution for the departure of Prie≈øts and Je≈øuites, out of his Maje≈øties Dominions.</p>
            <p>By rea≈øon of the Di≈ø≈øolving the Parliament, the <hi>Act of Sub≈øidies</hi> was prevented, and the King was nece≈ø≈øitated to take up Money upon <hi>Loan</hi> of ≈øuch Per≈øons as were of Ability to lend; and to that end he directed his Letters to the Lord Leiutenants of the ≈øeveral Counties, <hi>To return the Names of tho≈øe Men whom they thought mo≈øt ≈øufficient, The places of their Habitations, and what Sums each might be judged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lend;</hi> and to the per≈øons returned, Letters were I≈ø≈øued forth in the Kings Name to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe,</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66116:7"/>Services, which without manifold Inconveniences to his Majesty, and his Kingdoms cannot be deferr'd: and therefore this being the first time that his Maje≈øty hath required any thing of this kind, he doubts not but he ≈øhall receive ≈øuch a Te≈øtimony of good affection from them among other of his Subjects, and that with ≈øuch alacrity and readine≈øs as may make the ≈øame ≈øo much the more acceptable; e≈øpecially ≈øince his Maje≈øty required but the Sum which few men would deny a Friend, and has a mind re≈øolved to expo≈øe all his Earthly Fortune for Pre≈øervation of the General: The Sum which</hi> His Maje≈øty requires by the≈øe pre≈øents is‚Äî <hi>which His Maje≈øty promi≈øeth in the Name of him≈øelf, his Heirs, and Succe≈ø≈øors, to repay to them or their A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns, within Eighteen Months after the payment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Collector: The Per≈øon whom his Majesty hath appointed is ‚Äî to who≈øe</hi> hands his Maje≈øty doth require them to ≈øend it <hi>within Twelve days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have received this Privy Seal; which together with the Collectors Acquittance, ≈øhall be ≈øufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the Officers of Receipt for their payment thereof at the time limited: And the Collectors of the Loan</hi> were ordered to pay the Sums received into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and to return the Names of ≈øuch as went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to delay or excu≈øe the Payment of the Sums required.</p>
            <p>And now about the beginning of <hi>October</hi> the Fleet ≈øet to Sea, the Lord <hi>Cecill,</hi> ≈øecond Son to the Earl of <hi>Exeter,</hi> commanding the Land Forces, and the Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> being Vice Admiral at Sea; but they were ≈øurprized by ≈øo violent a Storm, that the greate≈øt part of the Navy, which in all made up Four≈øcore Ships (≈øome being <hi>Dutch)</hi> were di≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and ≈øcattered for ≈øeven days together, and an excellent Ship with an 170 Pa≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in her, were all ca≈øt away, and lo≈øt;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66116:7"/>the De≈øign was to have furprized <hi>Cadiz</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> to burn the Ships in the Harbour, and to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Plate Fleet, which was daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the <hi>Indies;</hi> but by rea≈øon of the Plague among≈øt them, and ≈øome other mi≈øcarriages of the Commanders, the bu≈øine≈øs was wholly di≈øappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Fleet returned home but four days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Plate Fleet came.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second of <hi>February</hi> was the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at which the King did not pa≈øs through the City in State from the <hi>Tower,</hi> as was u≈øual, but went by Water from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> for fear of the danger of a Concour≈øe of People; the Pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which raged the year before not being quite cea≈øed: The Bi≈øhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> as Dean of <hi>We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min≈øter,</hi> ≈øhould have performed the chief part of the Ceremony, but being under di≈øplea≈øure, Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> then Bi≈øhop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> ≈øupplied his place.</p>
            <p>Divers con≈øiderable Forces had been rai≈øed both for Sea and Land, for the better Di≈øcipline of whom, 150 old Souldiers were ≈øent for from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by who≈øe Indu≈øtry they were brought into ≈øome good order again≈øt the meeting of the next Parliament, which was ≈øummoned to ≈øit <hi>Feb.</hi> 6.

            <p>The fir≈øt bu≈øine≈øs they in≈øi≈øted upon, was the rendring thanks to the King for his gracious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to their late Petition concerning Religion, then they debated of the Publick Grievances, <hi>viz.</hi> The mi≈øcarrying of the Fleet at <hi>Cadiz;</hi> the evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors about the King; mi≈øimploying the Kings Revenue; an Account of the Sub≈øidies and three Fifteens, granted in the 21 Year of King <hi>James:</hi> And in the Committee of Grievances, the≈øe four particulars were in≈øi≈øted on: 1.

            <p>There was likewi≈øe a Committe concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the growth of Popery, wherein Mr. <hi>Richard Montagues</hi> two Books before mentioned were again que≈øtioned, and Articles drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, charging him with ≈øeveral Pa≈ø≈øages for encouraging Popery, and drawing his Maje≈øties Subjects from the true Religion E≈øtabli≈øhed into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Super≈øtition, with other pa≈ø≈øages di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the late King, and full of injurious and railing Language again≈øt other Per≈øons; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe that he endeavoured to rai≈øe Factions in the Kingdom, by ca≈øting the ≈øcandalous Name of <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> upon ≈øuch of his Maje≈øties Subjects as conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them≈øelves to the Doctrine of the Church of

               <hi>He must al≈øo put them in mind that his Father mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their Coun≈øel and won by their Per≈øwa≈øions, broke the Treaties; and that he him≈øelf was their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument towards his Father, and was glad to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrumental in any thing which might plea≈øe the whole Body of the Realm, nor was there any then in greater Favour than the Duke, whom they now traduced; but that now finding him ≈øo far intangled in a War, that he could make no honourable nor ≈øafe Retreat, they made nece≈ø≈øity their Priviledge, and ≈øet what rate they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed upon their Supplies,</hi> a Practi≈øe not very obliging <hi>towards Kings: and whereas Mr.</hi> Cook <hi>told them,</hi> That it was better for them to die by a Forreign Enemy, than to be de≈øtroyed at home: <hi>Indeed he thought it to be more Honourable for a King to be Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and almost de≈øtroyed by a Forreign Enemy, than to be de≈øpi≈øed at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, at a Conference of both Hou≈øes in the Painted Chamber, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was commanded by the King, to explain ≈øome Expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions in the Kings and the Lord Chancellors Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which might be ≈øubject to mi≈øunder≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which the Duke performed accordingly, and then gave a large Account of his Negotiation in the <hi>Low Countreys;</hi> as ≈øoon as the Duke had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> di≈øcour≈øed of the Treaties of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the bu≈øine≈øs of the Navy, and affirmed they were not done by ≈øingle Councel, ≈øince King <hi>James</hi> him≈øelf commanded it.</p>
            <p>The Commons in An≈øwer to the Kings la≈øt Speech, pre≈øented him with a Remon≈øtrance to this purpo≈øe; <hi>That they gratefully acknowledged His Maje≈øties Expre≈ø≈øions of Affection to his People and Parliament, That they had taken Mr.</hi> Cooks <hi>and Dr.</hi> Turners <hi>words into Con≈øideration, and might
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66116:11"/>have given a good Account thereof by this time, if his Maje≈øties Me≈ø≈øage had not interrupted them; That they had the Pre≈øidents of former Parliaments for ≈øearching the Letters of his Majesty and his Secretary of State, the Signet Office, and other Records, upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions. That it was the unque≈øtionable Priviledge of Parliaments to complain of any Per≈øon of any degree, and their proceedings in relation to the Duke ≈øhould not prejudice either Crown or Kingdom: That they were willing to Supply his Nece≈ø≈øities Liberally and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, if Additions might be made of other things which concerned his Service, and were now in Con≈øultation among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Maje≈øty having received it, returned this ≈øhort An≈øwer thereunto, <hi>That he would have them in the fir≈øt place, Con≈øult about Matters of the greate≈øt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and that they ≈øhould have time enough for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things afterward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This happened in the year 1626, and in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Year of his Maje≈øties Reign; about which time the Earl of <hi>Bri≈øtoll</hi> (being ordered by the King to be Examined by a Committee of Lords, concerning his Negotiation in <hi>Spain,</hi> and having been in Pri≈øon and prohibited acce≈øs to His Maje≈øty ever ≈øince his return) received a Letter from the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> wherein, in order to his Relief he propounded to him from His Maje≈øty this Choice, <hi>Whether he would be quiet, and not be que≈øtioned for what was pa≈øt, and enjoy the benefit of the late Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pardon? or whether he would ≈øtand upon his Ju≈øtification?</hi> To which he An≈øwered, <hi>That he did humbly acknowledge and accept of his Majesties Grace and Favour;</hi> And at the ≈øame time he Petitioned the Hou≈øe of Lords for his Liberty, or to come to a Tryal; who apylying them≈øelves to his Maje≈øty, he granted a Writ for the Earls coming to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66116:11"/>but with a Provi≈øo, That his Per≈øonal At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance ≈øhould be forborn; whereupon the Earl ≈øent another Petition to the Lords that he might be heard, both as to his Re≈øtraint, and of what he had to ≈øay again≈øt the Duke. At which the King was much concerned, and ≈øignified to the Lords, <hi>That it was his Royal Plea≈øure, that the Earl of</hi> Bri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol <hi>might be ≈øent for as a Delinquent to an≈øwer his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences to the Hou≈øe, and his ≈øcandalizing the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>and his Majesty likewi≈øe by Reflection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this the Earl was accordingly brought to the Bar, and being ready to be impeacht of High Trea≈øon by the Attorney General, he be≈øought their Lord≈øhips, <hi>That as he was a Freeman and Peer of this Realm untainted, and had ≈øomething to ≈øay of high Con≈øequence for his Maje≈øties Service, he might have liberty to ≈øpeak.</hi> Which being granted him, he ≈øaid, <hi>I accu≈øe that Man the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>of High Trea≈øon.</hi> This unexpected procedure of the Earl, occa≈øioned the Attorney General to draw up a Charge again≈øt him, con≈øi≈øting of Eleven Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles containing Matters of divers Natures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Earl afterwards gave a large Account of the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> proceedings towards him, and then preferr'd Twelve Articles again≈øt him; and be≈øides the≈øe Articles again≈øt the Duke, the Earl of <hi>Bri≈øtol</hi> exhibited Eleven others again≈øt the Lord <hi>Conway:</hi> the Earl likewi≈øe gave in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to each particular Article of his Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now whil≈øt the≈øe two Peers were thus conte≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Hou≈øe of Commons pre≈øented an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to the Lords again≈øt the Duke, con≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Twelve Articles, to each of which the Duke made Replies, and the la≈øt of them being a matter of general Di≈øcour≈øe, it may ≈øeem nece≈ø≈øary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert

            <p>About this time the King again earne≈øtly pre≈ø≈øed the Hou≈øe of Commons for a ≈øpeedy Supply, by their Speaker Sir <hi>Heneage Finch;</hi> giving them to under≈øtand, <hi>That if there did not pa≈øs the Bill of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidy by the end of the week following, it would inforce him to take other Re≈øolutions; and if by their denial, or delay, any thing of ill con≈øequence ≈øhould fall out ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at home, or abroad, he called God and Man to witne≈øs, that he had done his part to prevent it, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his People together to advi≈øe with him; who≈øe ≈øitting (if they di≈øpatched this according to his de≈øire) he re≈øolved to continue, for the di≈øpatch of other Affairs, and after their Rece≈øs to bring them again together the next Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the Commons ≈øent an An≈øwer, they drew up a Petition to his Maje≈øty. <q>That he would be plea≈øed to Remove from all places of Tru≈øt and Authority, all ≈øuch Per≈øons as were either Popi≈øh Recu≈øants, or according to the Direction of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Acts of State, ju≈øtly to be ≈øu≈øpected to be ≈øuch.</q> And herewith they likewi≈øe ≈øent a large Scrowl of the Names of all ≈øuch Noblemen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

            <p>The An≈øwer to the late Articles again≈øt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> being by him delivered into the Lords Hou≈øe, he de≈øired their Lord≈øhips to ≈øend to the Commons for a ≈øpeedy Reply; whereupon the Commons required a Copy of his An≈øwer. But the Duke fearing what might be the Effect thereof humbly applyed him≈øelf to the Lords, whom he intreated to allow him the benefit of a free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon granted by King <hi>James</hi> in Parliament in the 21≈øt. Year of his Reign, and likewi≈øe that of the Coronation.</p>
            <p>Pre≈øently after the Commons drew up another Declaration of Grievances again≈øt the Duke, whom they re≈øolved utterly to overthrow, though contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Inclination of the King; who being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at incen≈øed, di≈ø≈øolved the Parliament the very next day, <hi>June</hi> 15. 1626. and committed the Earl of <hi>Bri≈øtol</hi> to the Tower, Publi≈øhing a Proclamation for burning all Copies of the ≈øaid Declaration. After which the King Publi≈øhed a Declaration, ≈øhewing the Grounds and Rea≈øons of his Di≈ø≈øolving this and the former Parliament.</p>
            <p>Then ≈øeveral ways were Re≈øolved on for advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Revenue, and ≈øpecial care was taken by the Councel for the levying of Cu≈øtoms and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øts upon all Merchandizes Imported and Export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being intended to have been ≈øettled by the Two la≈øt Parliaments, but prevented by their ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Di≈ø≈øolution: The Forfeitures of Papi≈øts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, which had been mi≈øimployed, were now taken into a more ≈øtrict Account; <hi>Privy Seals</hi> al≈øo were i≈ø≈øued out, and <hi>Benevolence</hi> propo≈øed, and at length a Commi≈ø≈øion for a General <hi>Loan</hi> was re≈øolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, as the mo≈øt convenient Method, ≈øince the

            <p>About this time ≈øome Souldiers returned from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and were Quattered in the Countreys, and Money was rai≈øed for them, which made this Loan the more unwelcome; and Sir <hi>Randolph Crew</hi> for not appearing vigorous in promoting the Loan, was di≈øplaced from being L.

            <p>There were ≈øeveral Occa≈øions at this time which required con≈øiderable Supplies of Money, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides that of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> there was great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a War with <hi>France</hi> upon this Occa≈øion; the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13. had borrowed of his Brother in Law, the King of <hi>England,</hi> a Man of War called the <hi>Vauntguard,</hi> and ≈øix other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships in pur≈øuance of a De≈øign again≈øt <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but with this expre≈øs Condition that they ≈øhould not be imployed again≈øt the <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> at <hi>Rochel;</hi>

            <p>Before the Parliament began any debate, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to them Directed, <hi>To the Members of the Hou≈øe of Commons,</hi> called <hi>A Speech without Doors;</hi> di≈øcovering the Grievances and Inconveniences of the State, from one who had been a Member of the former Parliament. The fir≈øt thing taken into Con≈øideration by the Commons, was the Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdom, and the fir≈øt thing In≈øi≈øted on was the Ca≈øe of tho≈øe Gentlemen for refu≈øing the <hi>Loan,</hi> and who notwith≈øtanding their <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> were Remanded to Pri≈øon; and after a long Debate between ≈øeveral Members, who a≈ø≈øerted the Illegality of the Loan, and al≈øo their Impri≈øonment for refu≈øing it; the Lord Chief Ju≈øtice <hi>Hyde</hi> and ≈øeveral other Judges were de≈øired to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; who ju≈øtified their own proceedings, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That if they had granted them Bail upon</hi> Habeas Corpus, <hi>it would have reflected upon the King, as if he had unju≈øtly Impri≈øoned them:</hi> But in conclu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was re≈øolved upon the Que≈øtion in the Hou≈øe of Commons, <hi>Nemine Contradicente:</hi> 1. <hi>That no man ought to be restrained by the Command of the King or Privy Council, without ≈øome Cau≈øe of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Writ of</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>ought to be granted upon Reque≈øt to every Man that is re≈øtrained, though by the Command of the King, the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or any other.</hi> 3. <hi>That if a Freeman be impri≈øoned by the Command of the King, the Privy Council, or any other, and no Cau≈øe of ≈øuch Commitment expre≈ø≈øed, and the ≈øame be returned upon an</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>granted for the ≈øaid Party, then he ought to be delivered or Bailed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Parliament proceeded to draw up a Petition again≈øt <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Recu≈øants, con≈øi≈øting of the≈øe particulars. 1. <hi>That all Laws and Statutes again≈øt Je≈øuites and Popi≈øh Prie≈øts, be put in power and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi> 2. <hi>That a ≈øtrict cour≈øe be taken for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>
               <hi>All which we most humbly pray your mo≈øt Excellent Maje≈øty as their Rights and Liberties according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm; And that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty would al≈øo vouch≈øafe to declare, That all Awards, Doings, or proceedings, to the prejudice of your People, ≈øhall not be drawn hereafter into con≈øequence and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this there came a Letter from the King to the Hou≈øe of Lords, wherein among other things, His Maje≈øty declared it to be his Royal plea≈øure, which God willing he would ever continue and con≈øtantly maintain; <hi>That neither he, nor his Privy Council, ≈øhould or would hereafter, command to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, or otherwi≈øe restrain the Per≈øons of any for not lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money: nor for any Cau≈øe which in his Con≈øcience did not concern the publick good; nor would he be drawn to pretend any cau≈øe, wherein his judgment was not fully ≈øatisfied.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> Sir Thomas Wentworth (afterwards Earl of Strafford) ≈øaid, <hi>Was a Letter of Grace, but that the People were not ≈øo ≈øatisfied but by a Parliamentary way, That the debate would ≈øpend much time, That it was not directed to the Hou≈øe of Commons, and that the Petition it ≈øelf would rectify all mi≈øtakes.</hi> When the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> was pre≈øented to the King, the An≈øwer following was quickly returned; <hi>The King willeth that Right be done according to the Laws and Customs of the Realm; and that the Statutes be put in due Execution, that his Subjects may have no cau≈øe to complain of any wrong or Oppre≈ø≈øions, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            </p>
            <p>This An≈øwer being Read in the Hou≈øe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was not judged Satisfactory; and therefore upon their Humble Petition for a clear and ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory An≈øwer to the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> His Maje≈øty to ≈øhew how free and candid his Conce≈ø≈øions were to his Subjects, ≈øent them this ≈øhort but full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer; <hi>Soit Droit Lait come il e≈øt de≈øire,</hi> Let it be done according to your de≈øire. Which An≈øwer was Received with the general joy and Satisfaction of both Hou≈øes; and the Citizens made Bonefires, and Rung Bells, and his Maje≈øty for further Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was plea≈øed to receive into Favour <hi>Abbot,</hi> Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Bi≈øhop <hi>Williams,</hi> and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others: His Maje≈øty likewi≈øe ≈øuffered the Commi≈ø≈øion of Loan and Exci≈øe to be cancelled in his pre≈øence, ≈øo that all di≈øcontents of every ≈øide ≈øeemed to be bani≈øhed.</p>
            <p>In 1628 the Fourth year of his Maje≈øties Reign, the Parliament not being ≈øatisfied of their former di≈øappointment about the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> drew up another Remon≈øtrance again≈øt him, and likewi≈øe again≈øt Bi≈øhop <hi>Neal,</hi> and Bi≈øhop <hi>Laud,</hi> which they pre≈øented to the King with the Bill of Sub≈øidies: His Maje≈øty telling them, <hi>That he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ≈øuch a Return for his favourable An≈øwer to the</hi> petition of Right, <hi>and as for the Grievances he would take time to con≈øider of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Information being likewi≈øe Exhibited again≈øt the Duke in the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> for divers Offences and Mi≈ødemeanors, an Order was made in that Court, that all proceedings thereupon ≈øhould be taken off the File, by the Kings expre≈øs Will and Plea≈øure: And becau≈øe it had been reported by a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66116:19"/>Member of Parliament that the Duke ≈øhould ≈øay at his Table, <hi>Pi≈øh, it matters not what the Parliament doth, for without my leave and Authority, they ≈øhall not be able to touch the Hair of a Dog:</hi> The Duke made Prote≈øtation in the Hou≈øe of Lords, <hi>That be never had tho≈øe words ≈øo much as in his Thoughts.</hi> But the King being re≈øolved to hold up the Duke, ≈øent ≈øo brisk an An≈øwer to their Remon≈øtrances, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Commons (who had ≈øoon forgot his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øties late Act of Grace) to que≈øtion his taking Tunnage and Poundage; which being of too valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble con≈øideration to be hazarded, his Maje≈øty obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by Adjourning the Parliament to the 20th. of <hi>October,</hi> there being ≈øeveral Acts pa≈ø≈øed by them, One <hi>About the Lords day,</hi> Another <hi>To re≈øtrain the ≈øending any to be</hi> Popi≈øhly <hi>bread beyond the Seas,</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>for Confirmation of the Sub≈øidies granted by the Clergie, and for the grant of Five Entire Sub≈øidies upon the Temporality,</hi> and divers more.</p>
            <p>Much about this time Dr. <hi>Lamb, who was</hi> in great Favour with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (and had been formerly twice Arraigned, once for <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancy,</hi> and another time for a <hi>Rape</hi>) was killed by the furious Multitude in <hi>Lothbury,</hi> who hated him both for his own ≈øake and the Dukes, he being called the Dukes Devil; and though he were guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four Con≈øtables and their Attendants, yet the Rabble ≈øtruk him down, beat out one of his eyes, and left him half dead on the Ground, from whence he was called to the <hi>Poultrey Counter,</hi> where he died, according to his own Prediction the year before; being pitied by few, and loved of none.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Denbigh</hi> having a while ≈øince ≈øailed with Fifty Ships to the relief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> was repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with much lo≈øs; ≈øo that de≈øpairing of Succe≈øs, he returned back to <hi>Plymouth;</hi> whereupon another
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66116:20"/>Expedition was re≈øolved on, with a more con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Navy, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned Admiral, who going to <hi>Port≈ømouth,</hi> in order to ha≈øtning of bu≈øine≈øs, one <hi>John Felton</hi> a Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ≈øtabbed him to the heart with a Knife; which the Murtherer flying, left ≈øticking in his Body, till the Duke him≈øelf dragg'd it out, and immediately after died: <hi>Felton</hi> was ≈øoon apprehended by the Servants, and laden with Irons, and being asked, what inclined him to commit ≈øo horrid an Action? He boldly an≈øwered, <hi>He killed him for the cau≈øe of God and his Countrey:</hi> He likewi≈øe fa≈øtned a Paper in the Crown of his Hart, which intimated, <hi>That his only Motive to this Fact, was the late Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrance of the Commons again≈øt the Duke, and that he could not ≈øacrifice his Life in a nobler Cau≈øe, than by delivering his Countrey from ≈øo great an Enemy. Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was afterwards Condemned and Hanged at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn,</hi> and his Body hanged upon a Gibbet at <hi>Port≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was ob≈øervation made of divers Pa≈ø≈øages pre≈øaging the Dukes Death, as that his Picture fell down in the high Commi≈ø≈øion Chamber at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> That the Lady <hi>Davis</hi> reputed a Prophete≈øs, had foretold in <hi>June,</hi> that the Dukes fatal time would not come till <hi>Augu≈øt;</hi> and la≈øtly, that Mr. <hi>Tower≈øon</hi> of the <hi>Cu≈øtomhou≈øe</hi> was charged by a Phanta≈øm or Gho≈øt, re≈øembling the Dukes Father, to tell him, <hi>That if he changed not his cour≈øes, he ≈øhould ≈øhortly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a great Fairing to the City of</hi> London; which was afterwards judg'd to be accompli≈øhed by his death, which happened the day before the Fair, that is <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> 23. 1628.</p>
            <p>However the Fleet ≈øet Sail under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Lind≈øey,</hi> and came to the Bar of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> Haven, where there was a wonderful <hi>Barracado</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:66116:20"/>contrived by Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> of Fourteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Yards, cro≈øs the Channel; however the Earl adventured in, pa≈ø≈øing the Forts and Outworks, but the Wind changing, drove the Ships upon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which unhappy Accident made the <hi>Rochellers</hi> de≈øpair of Relief, and occa≈øioned the pre≈øent ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the Town; after which the Earl of <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øey</hi> brought the Fleet ≈øafe home again.</p>
            <p>The Parliament was to have met in <hi>October,</hi> but by rea≈øon of ≈øome ill news during this Expedition, they were again Adjourned to <hi>January</hi> 20th; in which time the Merchants refu≈øing to pay Cu≈øtom, had their goods ≈øeized; Complaint whereof being made to the Parliament, the King ≈øummons the two Hou≈øes to the Banquetting Hou≈øe at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and requires them to pa≈øs the promi≈øed Bill of <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> for ending all differences, ≈øince it was too precious a Jewel of the Crown to be ≈øo lightly forgone.</p>
            <p>But the Commons being forward enough to take all occa≈øions to put of the Kings Reque≈øts, An≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That Gods Cau≈øe was to be preferr'd before the Kings, and they would therefore in the fir≈øt place con≈øult con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion;</hi> and thereupon appointed one Committee for <hi>Religion,</hi> and another for <hi>Civil Matters;</hi> in the la≈øt wherof there was a complaint that the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> had been Printed with the Kings fir≈øt An≈øwer only, and not with the la≈øt which was judged Satisfactory: Another complaint was likewi≈øe made about the Cu≈øtoms, and Mr. <hi>Rolls</hi> a Member of the Hou≈øe affirmed, That it was reported ≈øome of the Officers of the Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe ≈øhould ≈øay, <hi>Though all the Parliament were in you, we would take your Goods;</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Chambers</hi> was likewi≈øe impri≈øoned for ≈øaying at the Council Table, <hi>That ≈øuch great Customs and Impo≈øitions were required

            <p>Upon <hi>May</hi> 29. 1630, the Queen was delivered of a Son at <hi>St. James</hi>'s, who was Chri≈øtened <hi>Charles;</hi> and Pre≈øerved by Providence, to Succeed his Father in the≈øe Three Kingdoms, as his Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inheritance, after the Mi≈øeries of a long and tedious Exile from his Native Countrey, unto which he was at length happily Re≈øtored, with the general Con≈øent and Acclamations of the whole Kingdom, The King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector <hi>Yalatine,</hi> repre≈øented by the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>Hamilton,</hi> were his Godfathers, and the <hi>Queen Mother</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> repre≈øented by the Dutche≈øs of <hi>Richmond,</hi> his Godmother, It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved that at his Nativity a Star was ≈øeen at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which might portend ≈øome extraordinary Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øages of this Princes Life.</p>
            <p>About this time Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi> was ≈øentenced in the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> to have his Body Whipt, his Fore-head Stigmatized, his Ears Cropt, his No≈øe Slit; for publi≈øhing a Book called <hi>Sions Plea:</hi> wherein he exhorted the late Parliament to ≈ømite the Bi≈øhops under the Fifth Rib; and called the Queen the Daughter of <hi>Heth,</hi> a <hi>Canaanite</hi> and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈øs: which Sentence was accordingly inflicted on him.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66116:25"/>were likewi≈øe Impri≈øoned for not A≈ø≈øi≈øting the Mayor; but ≈øome Papi≈øts making a Tumult, re≈øcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prie≈øts, whom the Guards again forced to deliver back. Upon Information of this Riot and In≈øolency, Fifteen Hou≈øes were by ≈øpecial Order from the Council ≈øeized upon for his Maje≈øties u≈øe; and the Prie≈øts and Fryers ≈øo di≈øturbed, that two of them hanged them≈øelves: Neither did the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts agree together, for there were great Conte≈øts in <hi>England</hi> between the <hi>Je≈øuites</hi> and Secular <hi>Priests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> had many years before marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lady <hi>Howard,</hi> who complaining of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øufficiency for Marriage Duties, the Cau≈øe was brought to a Tryal; and it being made appear by a Jury of Midwives and the Earls own Confe≈ø≈øion, <hi>That he never could, and believed he never ≈øhould, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally know her:</hi> Thereupon Sentence of Divorce between him and his Lady was pronounced by the Bi≈øhops: However the Earl was re≈øolved to try his Fortune once more, and therefore upon his return out of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> where he had been for ≈øome time a Souldier, he now Married a Daughter of Sir <hi>William Paulet</hi> of <hi>Wilt≈øhire;</hi> but a while after ≈øhe objecting the ≈øame cau≈øe of complaint, de≈øired likewi≈øe to be Divorced from him; which the Earl ea≈øily cou≈øented to, and it was done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>In the year 1631, and the 7th of his Maje≈øties Reign, <hi>Mervin</hi> Lord <hi>Audly,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Ca≈øtlehaven,</hi> was Tryed by his Peers upon the Petition of his own Son and Heir, for <hi>Rape and Sodomy;</hi> many unnatural and bea≈øtly Actions being proved again≈øt him: whereupon he received Sentence to be Hanged, but had the Favour to be Beheaded at <hi>Tower-hill.</hi> This Earl was born of a very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66116:25"/>Family, and educated in the <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> Religion, but turned Papi≈øt to have the more liberty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit wickedne≈øs; in which he grew to ≈øo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>height, that he impudently declared in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of ≈øome Lords, <hi>As others had their ≈øeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, ≈øome in one thing, ≈øome in another; ≈øo his whole Delight was in damning Souls, by enticing Men to ≈øuch Acts as might ≈øurely effect it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time Sir <hi>Giles Allington</hi> was Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Marrying his own Niece, and was fined Twelve thou≈øand Pound to the King, and to give Twenty thou≈øand Pound Bond never to cohabit, or come in private with his Niece again; and both of them to do Penance at St. <hi>Pauls Cro≈øs,</hi> or St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> which they accordingly did.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Protestants</hi> were very much di≈øcontented in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> were di≈øcharged from paying the State Penalty of Twelve Pence a Sunday for not going to Church; whereby their Number was wonderfully increa≈øed: Whereupon the King recalled the Lords Ju≈øtices, who then governed that Kingdom, and ≈øent Vi≈øcount <hi>Wentworth</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>) thither as Lord Deputy, as judging that the≈øe di≈øtempers would be better compo≈øed under a ≈øingle Government.</p>
            <p>In the year 1633, and the 9th of his Maje≈øties Reign, the King made a Journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> attended with ≈øeveral of the Nobility and Per≈øons of Quality; and <hi>June</hi> 18 was ≈øolemnly Crowned King at <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> which Solemnity being fini≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the King calls a Parliament, and pa≈ø≈øeth an Act for Ratification of the old Acts; though ≈øome affirmed, That the Confirmation of Epi≈øcopacy was intended thereby, and therefore (though in vain) oppo≈øed it; upon which ≈øome of tho≈øe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66116:26"/>became a while after principal Men among the Covenanters: In this <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> Parliament, that Nation ≈øhewed then ≈øome ≈øigns of diaffection to the King, by Rea≈øon of ≈øeveral Acts which then pa≈ø≈øed; and the generality of the People (who without doubt were influenced by the greater Malecontents) would not ≈øuffer the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blain,</hi> Dean of the Kings Private Chappel there, to perform Prayers twice a day after the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> manner; neither dur≈øt they receive the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou on their knees, nor wear a Surplice upon <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Holy days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long before his Maje≈øty went to <hi>Scotland,</hi> being de≈øirous, if po≈ø≈øible to have prevented that Trouble, the King writ to a <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> Lord who was intru≈øted with that Crown, to bring it into <hi>England,</hi> that he might be Crowned here; but the Lord returned An≈øwer, <hi>That he dur≈øt not be ≈øo fal≈øe to his Tru≈øt, but if his Maje≈øty would be plea≈øed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof in</hi> Scotland, <hi>he ≈øhould find tho≈øe his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ready to yield him the highe≈øt Honour; but if he ≈øhould long defer that Duty, they might perbaps be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to make choice of another King.</hi> A very ≈øtrange and unu≈øual An≈øwer from a Subject to a Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 13, 1633. The Queen was delivered of her Second Son, who was Baptized <hi>James,</hi> and de≈øigned Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and about that time died <hi>George Abbot</hi> L. Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>William Laud</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>London</hi> was Elected into his place.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1634 the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Coa≈øts were very much Infe≈øted by Pyrates, and the Fi≈øhing Trade almo≈øt ingro≈ø≈øed by the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty having occa≈øion for Money to Regain his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute Dominion over the <hi>Britti≈øh</hi> Seas, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign

            <p>The Di≈øcontents in <hi>Scotland</hi> began to increa≈øe, and a Book was publi≈øhed charging the King with indirect proceedings in the la≈øt Parliament and a tendancy to the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Belief, and to blow up the≈øe <hi>Scoth</hi> Sparks to a Flame, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> ≈øent over his Chaplain and another Gentleman, to heighten their Di≈øcontents: The Author of that Book was ≈øeized, and found to be abbetted by the Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> the Treacherous Son of a perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Father; who was thereupon Arraigned by his Peers, and Sentenced to Death, but Pardoned by the King.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Gregory Panzani</hi> a Prie≈øt, was ≈øen over by the Pope with a Commi≈ø≈øion of <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi> to decide the difference between the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuites</hi> and <hi>Secular</hi> Prie≈øts, and In≈øinuating him≈øelf into the Favour of the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Windebank,</hi> he endeavours to di≈øcover how far the King might be per≈øwaded about giving To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration to the <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Religion; as to allow them a <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Bi≈øhop to re≈øide here, but nominated and limited by the King; and that the Pope might ≈øend a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the Queen; but having made ≈øome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between the Je≈øuites and Prie≈øts <hi>Panzani</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and left the further tran≈øacting of Bu≈øine≈øs to Seignior <hi>Con,</hi> who ≈øtaid in his room.</p>

            <p>His Maje≈øty con≈øidering the good Succe≈øs of his former Fleet, fits out another in the year 1636, under the command of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who going Northward, ≈øcowred the Seas of the <hi>Holland</hi> Bu≈ø≈øes, and reduced them to de≈øire leave of his Maie≈øty to Fi≈øh there, which the King upon divers Con≈øiderations granted them.</p>

            <p>Yet this was ≈øo little regarded by the People, that the B. of <hi>Galloway</hi> going the next day to the <hi>Council</hi> was pur≈øued and a≈ø≈øaulted by them even to the <hi>Council Chamber;</hi> and being with difficulty got in, the Hou≈øe was pre≈øently incompa≈ø≈øed, and his Per≈øon peremptorily demanded; upon which tho≈øe within required Aid of the Provo≈øt and Council of <hi>Edenbourgh;</hi> but their Condition was as bad, being likewi≈øe be≈øet in their Town hou≈øe by the People, who would not let them go out till they had ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed, 1. <hi>To joyn in Oppo≈øition to the Service Book, and in Petitioning to that purpo≈øe.</hi> 2. <hi>To restore two or three of their ≈øilenced Ministers.</hi> Which being rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Council, the Lord <hi>Traqnair</hi> and another, went in Per≈øon to the Town Hou≈øe, where they found the Tumult ≈øomewhat quieted by tho≈øe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øions; but in coming back, they were furiou≈øly

            <p>This Declaration being publi≈øhed, the Marque≈øs and Council ≈øub≈øcribed the <hi>Covenanters Confe≈ø≈øion of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. yet ≈øtill ≈øome matter remained for a <hi>Prote≈øtation,</hi> which was read by one <hi>John≈øon;</hi> wherein the People were exhorted to con≈øider with whom they had to deal: and exceptions were made again≈øt Bi≈øhops, and their Voting in the <hi>A≈ø≈øembly:</hi> After this they Elect Commi≈ø≈øioners for the <hi>A≈ø≈øembly,</hi> whom they moved to cite the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øhops and Bi≈øhops to appear there, as Guilty Per≈øons; which being refu≈øed, they them≈øelves pre≈øent a Bill of Complaint again≈øt them to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery at <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> who accordingly warned them to appear at the next <hi>General A≈ø≈øembly:</hi> At their Meeting the Bi≈øhops ≈øent in a Prote≈øtation again≈øt

            <p>About this time a Letter was ≈øent by the <hi>Scots</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to implore his A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, Signed by ≈øeveral of the Nobility.

And la≈øtly, That upon disbanding their Forces,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66116:31"/>di≈ø≈øolving their Councils, and re≈øtoring the King to his Forts and Ca≈øtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the King was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call his Fleet and Forces, and make re≈øtitution of their Goods ≈øince the Breach.</p>
            <p>The Kings Declaration was no ≈øooner publi≈øhed, but the <hi>Covenanters</hi> ≈øet forth another <hi>Prote≈øtation,</hi> for adhereing to there <hi>A≈ø≈øembly</hi> at <hi>Gla≈øco,</hi> and their <hi>Covenant;</hi> whereupon the King, who intended to be pre≈øent at their <hi>General A≈ø≈øembly,</hi> not finding the <hi>Scots</hi> punctual in performing Articles, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they would treat of ≈øome matters di≈øta≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, goes into <hi>England;</hi> after which the <hi>A≈ø≈øembly</hi> ≈øate at <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> and aboli≈øhed <hi>Epi≈øcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> the <hi>Liturgy, High Commi≈ø≈øion,</hi> and <hi>Book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons;</hi> and then made ≈øeveral demands of the King of a various nature.</p>
            <p>His Maje≈øty under≈øtanding how things went, and that the <hi>Scots</hi> levyed Taxes and prepared Arms, he commanded by his Commi≈ø≈øioner, the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> that their <hi>Parliament</hi> ≈øhould be Adjourned for ≈øome time; but the <hi>Covenanters</hi> declared again≈øt this Command, and ≈øent a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrance to the King; and afterward <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Traquair,</hi> likewi≈øe came to <hi>London,</hi> where there were ≈øuch proceedings, as did the more exa≈øperate the jarring parties again≈øt each other.</p>
            <p>In this year 1639, a <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Fleet of near Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sail, and Twenty five thou≈øand Men, de≈øigned to be landed at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> for the relief of <hi>Flanders,</hi> were ≈øet upon by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and Eleven of them taken and ≈øent into <hi>Holland;</hi> three peri≈øhed upon the Coa≈øt of <hi>France,</hi> one near <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and five were ≈øunk in the Fight. What the real intent of this Fleet was, is yet uncertain; for it ≈øeemed unlikely that Twenty five thou≈øand Men ≈øhould be ≈øent only for a Recruit, and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66116:32"/>refu≈øing to ≈øhew his Commi≈ø≈øion when requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereto by the King, makes it ≈øeem yet mon ≈øu≈øpicious.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Commi≈ø≈øioners having delivered their Me≈ø≈øage, return home to <hi>Edenbourgh, Nov.</hi> 19. 1639. the ≈øame night that a great part of the Ca≈øtle Walls fell down, and the Anniver≈øary of the King Birth day. A while after the King ≈øent the Lord <hi>E≈øtrich,</hi> and others, to tepair the Walls, who were re≈øi≈øted by the <hi>Covenanters;</hi> as not judging the Lord <hi>E≈øtrich</hi> to be a fit Governour for the Ca≈øtle; which Office was de≈øigned him by the King. The King being hereat extreamly offended, re≈øolved, ≈øince fair means would not prevail, to force the <hi>Scots</hi> to rea≈øon, and to that end con≈øiders how to make provi≈øions for Men and Money; and calling a ≈øecret Cabinet Council, con≈øi≈øting only of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øhop <hi>Laud,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> (who drove on his own particular intere≈øt) it was concluded. <hi>That for the Kings ≈øupply a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mu≈øt be called in</hi> England, <hi>and another in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but becau≈øe the Debates of Parliament would take up ≈øome time, it was re≈øolved, that the Lords ≈øhould ≈øub≈øcribe to lend the King money. The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> ≈øub≈øcribed Twenty thou≈øand pound, the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> as much; but <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> pretended poverty. pre≈øerving his money for other u≈øes; the re≈øt of the Lords, Judges, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and other Dependants, and many of the Gentry, yea, even ≈øeveral <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Recu≈øants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed according to their ability.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> on the other ≈øide fore-≈øeeing the ≈øtorm, prepared for their own Defence, making Treaties in <hi>Denmark, Sweden, Holland</hi> and <hi>Poland;</hi> and the <hi>Je≈øuits,</hi> who are never idle, did likewi≈øe endeavour to foment the differences; to which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66116:32"/>end <hi>Con</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> Sir <hi>Toby Matthews, Read</hi> and <hi>Maxwell,</hi> two <hi>Scots,</hi> endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade the di≈øcontented People, <hi>That the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned to iu≈ølave them to his will and plea≈øure.</hi> Which practices of theirs were di≈øcovered by <hi>Andreas Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bern≈øfield,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who declared, That many of the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> and chief Favourites at Court, were con≈øenting to the≈øe Tran≈øactions, and particularly the Earl and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øs of <hi>Arundel,</hi> Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> and <hi>Endymion Porter.

            <p>In the year 1640, and the Sixteenth of the King, a Parliament was called at <hi>We≈øtminster, April</hi> 13. in which the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was highly honoured for his good ≈øervice in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in obtaining four Sub≈øidies, to maintain Ten thou≈øand Foot, and Fifteen hundred Hor≈øe. And that <hi>England</hi> might follow this Example, the King tells the Parliament, that if they would ≈øupply him, ≈øo as to ≈øuppre≈øs the In≈øolencies of the <hi>Scots,</hi> he would acquit his claim to <hi>Shipmoney,</hi> and giue ≈øatisfaction to their ju≈øt Demands. By which Propo≈øals the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ≈øen≈øible of the Kings Nece≈ø≈øities, and therefore required ≈øatisfaction, 1. <hi>For clearing the Property of the Subject.</hi> 2. <hi>For e≈øtabli≈øhing the True Religion.</hi> 3. <hi>For Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whil≈øt they were debating whether the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the People or the Kings Supply ≈øhould be fir≈øt con≈øidered, and Matters were in an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful po≈øture, Secretary <hi>Vane,</hi> either accidentally, or on purpo≈øe, overthrew all at once, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66116:33"/>that the King required Twelve Sub≈øidies whereas he at that time only de≈øired Six; which ≈øo much inraged the Hou≈øe, and made things ≈øo ill that by the Advice of the <hi>Junto</hi> the Parliament was di≈ø≈øolved, having only ≈øate Twenty two days; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Privy Councel likewi≈øe advi≈øed their Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolving, being a≈ø≈øured the heats in the <hi>Hou≈øe of Commons</hi> were ≈øo great, that they intended that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to have voted again≈øt the War with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> whereby the King would have been in a wor≈øe condition than before their ≈øitting.</p>
            <p>About the ≈øame time a Convocation of Bi≈øhops ≈øate, with Commi≈ø≈øion to make ≈øuch Canons as they judged for the peace of the Church; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt other things, they impo≈øed an Oath called, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> had been now quartered in <hi>England</hi> five months, during which a Ce≈ø≈øation had been concluded at <hi>Rippon,</hi> but the full Pacification was re≈øerved for <hi>London,</hi> where Commi≈ø≈øioners ≈øate on both Parties to hear the Demands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to make an≈øwer thereunto.

            <p>Upon <hi>Monday March</hi> 26, 1640. the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> Tryal began in <hi>Westmin≈øter-hall,</hi> the King, Queen, and Prince being pre≈øent; and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> likewi≈øe being there as a Committee at the managing their Accu≈øation; the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was Lord High Steward, and the Earl of <hi>Lind≈øey</hi> Lord High Con≈øtable, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> though he had but ≈øhort warning, yet had gotten his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ready again≈øt the time. The Accu≈øation was managed by Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> con≈øi≈øting of Twenty eight Articles, to mo≈øt of which the Earl made Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Replies.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Commons</hi> were re≈øolved to pro≈øecute him to the utmo≈øt, and had therefore procured the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Ireland</hi> to pro≈øecute him there al≈øo, as guilty of High Trea≈øon; which being unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced, extorted from the Earl this pa≈ø≈øionate Expre≈ø≈øion, <hi>That there was a Con≈øpiracy again≈øt him, to take away his Life.</hi> At which the <hi>Commons</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out again≈øt him, <hi>That standing Impeached of High Trea≈øon, he dur≈øt accu≈øe the Parliament of two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Con≈øpiracy again≈øt him.</hi> But be≈øides all the≈øe, certain notes were produced again≈øt him, which were taken by Sir <hi>H. Vane</hi> in a clo≈øe Committee of ≈øelect Coun≈øellors, whom the King had cho≈øen to con≈øult about his ≈øecond Expedition again≈øt the <hi>Scots;</hi> out of which it was alledged again≈øt the Earl, <hi>That he had given the King advice to borrow an Hundred thou≈øand pound of the City of</hi> London, <hi>To levy Ship-money rigorou≈øly; and that his Maje≈øty having tryed the Affections of his People, was ab≈øolved and loo≈øed from all Rules of Government, and might do what power would admit; and having an Army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>might imploy it for the reducing of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he was ≈øure could not hold out five months: And</hi> London <hi>being full of the Nobility, the</hi> Commi≈ø≈øion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66116:39"/>of Array <hi>was to be ≈øet on foot, and all Oppo≈øers thereof to be ≈øeverely dealt with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Earl replyed, <q>That he conceived it lawful for a Privy Coun≈øellor to have freedom of Voting with others; and as to the matter of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Army, he thought that the ≈øingle Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony of one man (Secretary <hi>Vane</hi>) was not of Validity in Law, much le≈øs in Life and Death, and that the Depo≈øitions of Secretary <hi>Vane</hi> was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as appeared by ≈øeveral Examinations, and that there were pre≈øent at the Debate but eight Privy Coun≈øellors, whereof two were not to be produced, and four others declared upon their Honours that they never heard him ≈øpeak tho≈øe words, or any like them; and la≈øtly that if he had ≈øpoken them (which he yet granted not) that the word <hi>This</hi> Kingdom, could not imply <hi>England,</hi> the debate being concerning <hi>Scotland,</hi> there being not the lea≈øt intention of Landing the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Army in <hi>England;</hi> and concluded his Defence with tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Lords, that he was accu≈øed as guilty of Trea≈øon for endeavouring to ≈øubvert the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of the Land, but it ≈øeemed ≈øtrange to him that it ≈øhould be Trea≈øon together which was not Trea≈øon in any part; and la≈øtly, de≈øired the Lords to con≈øider how their own Priviledges, and other Mini≈øters of State, would ≈øuffer by his Condemnation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Commons</hi> mu≈øt now ju≈øtifie their Charge by Law, to which end they produced the <hi>Salvo</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Stat. of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. The words were the≈øe, <hi>Becau≈øe all particular Trea≈øons could not be then defined; therefore what the Parliament ≈øhould declare to be Trea≈øon, in time to come ≈øhould be puni≈øhed as Trea≈øon;</hi> And ≈øo this <hi>Salvo</hi> was to be the Ground work of the <hi>Bill of Attainder.</hi> This being a point of Law, the Earl had Council allowed him, who an≈øwered
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66116:40"/>on his behalf, <hi>That the Statute which they cited was but a Declarative and a Penal Law, awd would no way admit of ≈øuch Con≈øequential and Inferential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and that this</hi> Salvo <hi>was repealed by an Act of Parliament in the Sixth of</hi> Henry <hi>the fourth.</hi> And ≈øo the Court Adjourned without prefixing any time of Meeting; for the Commons proceeded to di≈øpatch their <hi>Bill of Attainder,</hi> and <hi>April</hi> 19, 1641, they Voted the Earl Guilty of High Trea≈øon, upon the Evidence of Secretary <hi>Vane</hi> and his Notes; And upon the 25th. they pa≈ø≈øed the Bill and ≈øent to the Lords for their Concurrence, to whom it ≈øeemed at fir≈øt ≈øo perplext a bu≈øine≈øs, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were forced to ≈øend Mr. <hi>Saint John</hi> the Kings Sollicitor, to confer with them about it, who gave them ≈øuch ≈øatisfaction, that thence forward they ≈øhewed greater propen≈øity to the Earls Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Commons petitioned the King, 1. <hi>To remove all Papists from Court.</hi> 2. <hi>For di≈øarming of them generally throughout the Kingdom.</hi> 3. <hi>For disbanding the</hi> Iri≈øh <hi>Army.</hi> To which the King an≈øwered, 1. <hi>They all knew what Legal Tru≈øt the Crown hath in that particular, therefore he ≈øhall not need to ≈øay any thing to a≈ø≈øure them that he ≈øhall u≈øe it ≈øo, as there ≈øhall be no ju≈øt cau≈øe of ≈øcandal.</hi> 2. <hi>As for the ≈øecond he is content it ≈øhall be done by Law.

            <p>The Hou≈øe of Commons having fini≈øhed their <hi>Bill of Attainder</hi> again≈øt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the King fearing the Conclu≈øion, and being willing to do ≈øome good Office to him, His Maje≈øty <hi>May</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 5.

            <p>The Commons had now fini≈øhed a Bill, <hi>For the Continuance of the Parliament;</hi> which having pa≈ø≈øed the Lords, was tendred to the King to be ≈øigned; together with the <hi>Bill of Attainder,</hi> His Maje≈øty an≈øwered, That on Monday following he would ≈øatisfie them; and on the Sunday before the King ≈øpent the whole day in con≈øulting about the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> with the Judges and Bi≈øhops: The Judges told him, <hi>That in point of Law (according to the Oath made by</hi> Sir H.

            <p>Monday <hi>May</hi> 10.

               <hi>October</hi> 23, 1641. A Horrid and Notorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion broke out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was managed with ≈øuch ≈øecrecy, that it was not di≈øcovered till the night before it was to have been put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which was in divers places carried on with ≈øuch fury, that Two hundred thou≈øand <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Men, Women, and Children, were in a ≈øhort ≈øpace barbarou≈øly murdered by all manner of mo≈øt cruel torments that their Devli≈øh minds could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.

            </p>
            <p>This bloody Rebellion happened in a time wherein the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> had all the Priviledges and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they could rea≈øonably expect, and the ancient hatred which the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> had born to the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> did now ≈øeem to be forgotten, Forty Years of Peace having compacted and cemented them together, both by Alliances and Marriages, which were all now mi≈øerably broken and de≈øtroyed. The Ca≈øtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> wherein were Ten thou≈øand Arms, and all other Forts and Magazines in the Kingdom, were to have been ≈øurprized, and all the <hi>Engli≈øh Protestants</hi> that would not joyn with them, were to be murdered; but the ≈øeizing of the Ca≈øtle was happily prevented by one <hi>Owen Conally,</hi> from ≈øome di≈øcour≈øe accidentally in a Tavern with one <hi>Hugh Mac Mahon,</hi> Grand≈øon to the Great Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> the night before the intended Execution.</p>
            <p>Upon this Di≈øcovery <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> and Lord <hi>Mac-Guire,</hi> were ≈øeized by the Lord Chief Ju≈øtices of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and many Principal Con≈øpirators e≈øcaped that night out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> ≈øo was <hi>Dublin</hi> ≈øaved, that all <hi>Ireland</hi> might not be lo≈øt in one day.

            <p>To their Petition the King returned this An≈øwer, <hi>That he knows not any Wicked or Malignant Per≈øons whom he doth either countenance or imploy; That he would concur with his People in a Parliamentary way again≈øt all</hi> Popi≈øh <hi>De≈øigns, but would not con≈øent to deprive the Bi≈øhops of their Votes in Parliament: That he judged the power of the Clergy ≈øufficiently moderated by taking away the High Commi≈ø≈øion Court, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no further Abridgment; That he was willing to concur with them for removal of any Innovations in Religion by a National Synod; That he had no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øellors nor Mini≈øters of State whom he would not at any time expo≈øe to Trial, and leave to the Law, but cannot agree that any others ≈øhould have the choice of them but him≈øelf, That he concurs with them for not altering the Forfeited Lands in</hi> Ireland, <hi>but thinks it not rea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to re≈øolve, before the Event of War be ≈øeen; and doubts not of their Loyal Endeavours for the ≈øupport of his Royal State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In An≈øwer to the Remon≈øtrance, the King I≈ø≈øues out a Declaration to his Subjects, the Sum of which was, <hi>That he thought he had given ≈øufficient ≈øatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Hereupon the King charges the L. <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the 5 Members with ≈øeveral Articles, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints both Hou≈øes, <hi>That he did intend to pro≈øecute them for High Trea≈øon, and required that their Per≈øons might be ≈øecured:</hi> And the next day the King At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his Guard of Pen≈øioners, and ≈øome Hundreds of Gentlemen, went to the Hou≈øe of Commons, and the Guard ≈øtaying without, the King with the <hi>Pal≈øgrave,</hi> entred the Hou≈øe, at who≈øe entrance the Speaker ri≈øes out of the Chair, and the King ≈øitting down therein, Views the Hou≈øe round, and perceives the Birds he aimed at were flown, for having warning they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn into <hi>London;</hi> whereupon he tells them, <hi>That he came to look for tho≈øe</hi> 5 <hi>Members whom he had accu≈øed of High Trea≈øon and was re≈øolved to have them where ever he found them; and expected to have them ≈øent to him as ≈øoon as they ≈øhould come to the Hou≈øe; but would not have them think that this Act of his was any Violation of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Act of the Kings was ≈øo highly re≈øented by the Hou≈øe, that the next day <hi>January</hi> 5, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Voted it a Breach of Priviledge, and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals were rai≈øed in the City, that he intended Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence again≈øt the Hou≈øe of Commons, and came thither with force to Murther ≈øeveral Members, and u≈øed threatning Speeches again≈øt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; with which the City was ≈øo po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, That unu≈øual Guards and Watches were ≈øet, as if ≈øome de≈øperate A≈ø≈øault were to be made upon the City, and the Hou≈øes Adjourned till the Tue≈øday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, appointing a Committee in the mean time to ≈øit at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> to con≈øider of the mo≈øt Effectual Means for their Security.

            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Londoners</hi> came thronging to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> with Petitions, inveighing bitterly again≈øt ≈øome of the Peers, but e≈øpecially the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops, whom they affronted as they went to the Hou≈øe; upon which they were ≈øo affrighted, that Twelve Bi≈øhops ab≈øent them≈øelves from the Hou≈øe of Lords, drawing up a Prote≈øtation again≈øt all Laws, Orders, Votes, Re≈øolutions, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, as in them≈øelves null and of none effect, which had pa≈ø≈øed, or ≈øhould pa≈øs, during their forced Ab≈øence; de≈øiring their Prote≈øtation might be entred by the Clerk of the Hou≈øe of Peers.

            <p>The King at this time, thinking him≈øelf un≈øafe without a Guard, accepted of the offer of ≈øome

            </p>
            <p>But the Hou≈øe of Commons, to obviate this, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øu≈øpicion of ≈øome de≈øign upon their per≈øons, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the King for a Guard, to be commanded by the Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> of who≈øe fidelity to the King and State, no que≈øtion was ever made.

            <p>This An≈øwer being un≈øatisfactory, the City joyn with them, and in their Common Council drew up a Petition, complaining, <hi>That the Trade of the City was decayed, to the utter Ruin of the</hi> Prote≈øtant Religion, <hi>and the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, by the De≈øigns of</hi> Papi≈øts, Foreigners and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me≈øticks <hi>(more particularly their fomenting the Iri≈øh Rebellion) by changing the Con≈øtable of the Tower, and

            <p>To their Petition the King returned An≈øwer <hi>That he could not expre≈øs a greater ≈øen≈øe of</hi> Ireland <hi>that he had done; That meerly to ≈øatisfie the City, he had removed a worthy Per≈øon from the charge of the</hi> Tower; <hi>and that the late Tumults had cau≈øed him to fortifie</hi> White-hall, <hi>for the ≈øecurity of his own Per≈øon, That his going to the Hou≈øe of Commons was to apprehend tho≈øe five Members for Trea≈øon, to which the Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Parliament could not extend; and that yet he would proceed again≈øt them no otherwi≈øe than le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally.</hi>

            <p>After this the Commons move the Lords to joyn with them in Petitioning for the <hi>Militia</hi> and the Command of the <hi>Tower,</hi> but they not complying, the Hou≈øe of Commons ≈øingly of them≈øelves Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune the King to put tho≈øe things into the hands of the Parliament, as the only available means for removal of their Fears and Jealou≈øies.

            <p>In the mean time Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> at a Conferrence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the General Flocking of Papi≈øts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> affirmed, <hi>That ≈øince the Lieutenant had ordered a ≈øtop upon the Ports again≈øt all</hi> Iri≈øh <hi>Papi≈øts, many of the Chief Commanders, now in the head of the Rebels, had been licen≈øed to pa≈øs thither by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties immediate Warrant.</hi> The King was highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this Speech, which he ≈øignified to the Hou≈øe, who in their An≈øwer to his Me≈ø≈øage, ju≈øtifie Mr. <hi>Pym</hi>'s words to be the ≈øen≈øe of the Hou≈øe, and, <hi>That they had yet in ≈øafe Ou≈øtody the Lord</hi> Delvin, <hi>Sir</hi> George Hamilton, <hi>Colonel</hi> Butler, Brother to the Lord <hi>Miniard,</hi> now in Rebellion, and one of the Lord <hi>Nettervils</hi> Sons: To which the King replies, <hi>That he thought Mr.</hi> Pym<hi>'s Speech was not ≈øo well grounded as it ought to have been, and that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned per≈øons had their Pa≈ø≈øes granted before he knew of the Parliaments Order of Restraint; and therefore expected their Declaration for his Vindication from thut odious calumny of conniving, or underhand favouring that abhorred Iri≈øh Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this His Maje≈øties de≈øire proved fruitle≈øs, for they next moved the King to turn out Sir <hi>John By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> out of the Lieutenancy of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and at their Nomination Sir <hi>John Conyers</hi> ≈øucceeded; they then proceeded to name fit Per≈øons for tru≈øt of the <hi>Militia</hi> in the ≈øeveral Counties, and by Act of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66116:51"/>Parliament <hi>Di≈øabled all Clergy-men from exerci≈øing Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Juri≈ødiction:</hi> After which the King by a Me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage offers them, <hi>To require by Proclamation all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes concerning</hi> Popi≈øh <hi>Recu≈øants to be put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That the ≈øeven Condemned Popi≈øh Prie≈øts ≈øhall be Bani≈øhed, and all Romi≈øh Prie≈øts within twenty days ≈øhall depart the Kingdom; That he refers the con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church Government and Liturgy wholly to the Hou≈øes, and offers to go him≈øelf in Per≈øon against the Rebels in</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>But the Commons were now bu≈øie about a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Vindicating their Five Members, wherein they de≈øire the King to ≈øend them the Informers again≈øt the ≈øaid Members, or otherwi≈øe to de≈øert their Pro≈øecution would not ≈øuffice; becau≈øe the whole Parliament was concerned in the Charge. And then they proceeded to ≈øettle the <hi>Militia</hi> for the defence of the Parliament, Tower, and City of <hi>London,</hi> under the Command of Serjeant Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Skippon,</hi> who had formerly been an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Souldier in the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> The King had deferred his An≈øwer to their Petition for ≈øettling the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Counties, according to their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, till his return from <hi>Dover,</hi> where he took leave of his Wife and Daughter, and ≈øo returned to <hi>Greenwich;</hi> from whence he ≈øent to <hi>Hampton Court</hi> for his two Elde≈øt Sons to come to him, though contrary to the mind of the Parliament, who would have di≈ø≈øwaded him from it.</p>
            <p>And now the Parliament thought fit to con≈øider of the reducing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ordered two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and an half of tho≈øe Acres to be Confi≈øcate, of Rebels Lands in Four Provinces, ≈øhall be allotted to ≈øuch Per≈øons as will disbur≈øe Money for carrying on that War, and ≈øeveral other Provi≈øions were made for their Security, which the King confirms

               <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. 1641; and in pur≈øuance thereof a con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sum of Money was rai≈øed, the People being generally free in their Contributions.</p>
            <p>The King being now at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> ≈øends this An≈øwer to the Petition about the <hi>Militia, That he is willing to conde≈øcend to all the Propo≈øals concerning the</hi> Militia <hi>of the Counties, and the Per≈øons mentioned, but not of</hi> London, <hi>and other Corporations, who≈øe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in that particular, he thought it neither Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice nor Policy to alter; but would not con≈øent to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest him≈øelf of the Power of the County</hi> Militia <hi>for an indefinite time, but for ≈øome limited ≈øpace,</hi> This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer did not ≈øatisfie, ≈øo that the Breach growing daily wider, the King declined the≈øe parts and the Parliament, and removed to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> taking with him, the Prince, and the D. of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>March</hi> he receives a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition from the Parliament, wherein they require the <hi>Militia</hi> more re≈øolutely than before, affirming, <hi>Than in ca≈øe of denial, the imminent dangers would con≈øtrain them to di≈øpo≈øe of it by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; de≈øiring al≈øo that he would make his abode near</hi> London <hi>and the Parliament, and continue the Prince at ≈øome of his Hou≈øes near the City, for the better car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of Affairs and preventing the Peoples Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies and Fears;</hi> All which being refu≈øed, They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently Order, <hi>That the Kingdom be put into a po≈øture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:66116:52"/>
            <p>And now began our Troubles, and all the Mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a Civil War; the Parliament every day entertaining (or pretending to entertain) new Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øies and Su≈øpicions of the Kings Actions, which how≈øoever in complement, they made ≈øhew of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting only to his Evil Council, yet obliquely had had too great a Reflection upon his Per≈øon. They now proceed on a ≈øudden to make great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both by Sea and Land; and the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> is commanded to rig the Kings Ships and fit them for Sea; and likwi≈øe all Ma≈øters and Owners of Ships were per≈øwaded to do the like.

            <p>The King being now at <hi>Roy≈øion, March</hi> 9, the Earls of <hi>Pembrook</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> bring him the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Declaration, and read it to him; wherein they repre≈øent to him ≈øome former mi≈øcarriages: <hi>As the attempts to incen≈øe the late</hi> Nor hern <hi>Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Parliament.

The ≈øu≈øpicious de≈øigning a Guard about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and under hand promoting the</hi> Iri≈øh <hi>Rebellion. The ordering Sir</hi> John Pennington <hi>to land the Lord</hi> Digby <hi>beyond Sea; from thence to alienate the King from his Parliament, and to procure Forreign Forces for his A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øistance; which now (≈øaid they) appeared more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible by rea≈øon of his removal with the Prince, and the manifold Adverti≈øements from</hi> Rome, Venice, Paris, <hi>and other parts, certifying that the Popes</hi> Nuncio <hi>had ≈øollicited the Kings of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>to lend his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66116:53"/>Maje≈øty</hi> 4000 <hi>Men apeice in reference to ≈øome De≈øign again≈øt Religion and the Parliament, and lastly, They de≈øire him to turn away his wicked Councellors, and to rely upon his Parliament, which if he would do, they would ≈øacrifice their Lives, Fortunes, and utmo≈øt endeavours to the Supportation of his Soveraignty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the reading of the Declaration, the Lords would have per≈øwaded the King to come near the the Parliament, and to grant the <hi>Militia</hi> for a time; which his Maje≈øty refu≈øed, and told them in ≈øhort, <hi>That their Fears, and Doubts and Jealou≈øies were ≈øuch as he would take time to ≈øatisfy the whole World of; but that his own doubts were not Trivial, occa≈øioned by ≈øo many Scandalous Pamphlets, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Sermons; divers publick Tumults hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inquired into, and unpuni≈øhed;</hi> and ≈øometime after the King publi≈øhed a Declaration to the People, in An≈øwer to theirs; the ≈øum of which was.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That he had no evil Councellors about him, but leaves ≈øuch to their cen≈øure where they ≈øhould find them. That he de≈øired the Judgments of Heaven might be manife≈øted upon tho≈øe who had any de≈øign again≈øt the <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> Profe≈ø≈øion. That the <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> Troubles were buried in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ≈øilence, by the <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> and pa≈ø≈øed in Parliaments of both Kingdoms. That they charging him with any inclining to the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Rebels, was a high and cau≈øle≈øs injury to his Royal Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. That he never intended to exa≈øperate the late Army, or in any wi≈øe to u≈øe them again≈øt the Parliament. That Captain <hi>Leg's</hi> Petition was brought to him, ≈øub≈øcribed by the Officers of the Army, de≈øiring that the Parliament might not be hindred from reforming the Church and State, to the Model of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days; and was advantageous to them: And to a≈ø≈øure Sir <hi>Jacob
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66116:53"/>A≈øhly</hi> of his Opinion therein, he writ <hi>C.

That he had given ≈øufficient An≈øwer about <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the five Members. That the care of his own ≈øafety cau≈øed him to rai≈øe a Guard at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and to receive the Loyal Tender, which the Gentlemen of the <hi>Inns of Court</hi> did make him of their Service. And that he looked upon their Forreign Adverti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by them mentioned, as meerly wild and irrational.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King goes further <hi>Northward,</hi> whil≈øt the Parliament Voted the Ordinance for Defence of the Kingdom, not to be prejudicial to the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> but to be obeyed as the Fundamental Laws; and that the Kings Commands for Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy over the ≈øeveral Counties were illegal and void; but he coming to <hi>Huntington</hi> ≈øends them a Me≈ø≈øage, <hi>March</hi> 15. <hi>That he intends to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidence at</hi> York, <hi>and de≈øires them to hasten their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours for</hi> Ireland, <hi>and not upon any pretence of Order or Ordinance (to which he is not a Party) of the</hi> Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, <hi>or any other thing, to Do or Execute against the Laws, which he him≈øelf was to keep, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey, declaring his Subjects not to be obliged to obey any Act, Order, or Injunction to which he hath not given con≈øent:</hi> In an≈øwer to which, they re≈øolve <hi>That the ab≈øence of the King ≈øo far from his Parliament; was de≈øtructive to the Relief of</hi> Ireland; <hi>and therefore all tho≈øe Councellors which advi≈øed him to it, are to be ≈øu≈øpected as Favourers of that bloody Rebellion, as likewi≈øe tho≈øe who per≈øwaded his Maje≈øty to que≈øtion or contradict their Votes, which was a high breach of Priviledge of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 16. The King at <hi>Stamford</hi> publi≈øhed a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66116:54"/>Proclamation for putting the Laws in Execution again≈øt <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Recu≈øants; and from thence he goes to <hi>York,</hi> and there <hi>March</hi> 24, Repeals his Grant for pa≈ø≈øing the <hi>Bill against Tonnage and Poundage,</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 22 la≈øt pa≈øt, commanding the payment thereof for the future, according to the Act of the Fir≈øt of King <hi>James;</hi> and ≈øo this year ended.</p>
            <p>It was now the year 1642, and the 18th of his Maje≈øties Reign, when a fre≈øh Difference aro≈øe; for the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> being indi≈øpo≈øed, the King ordered Sir <hi>John Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington,</hi> Vice Admiral, to take the charge of the Summer Fleet for the Narrow Seas; but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament earne≈øtly de≈øired that it might be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> but were refu≈øed by the King to their great di≈øta≈øte. During the A≈ø≈øizes at <hi>York,</hi> the Gentry, Mini≈øters, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of that County, pre≈øented a Petition to the King, to endeavour an Agreement with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who advi≈øes them to apply them≈øelves to the Parliament, for the good of all. And next day he ≈øends a Me≈ø≈øage to the Hou≈øes, <q>That he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to rai≈øe his Guard out of the Counties near <hi>Chester,</hi> Two thou≈øand Foot and Two hundred Hor≈øe, to be ≈øupplied with Arms from the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine at <hi>Hull,</hi> upon taking the Oaths of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Allegiance, That if the Parliaments Undertaking for the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> War, would not ≈øuffice to defray the Charges of rai≈øing and paying them, he would pawn or ≈øell his Land or Hou≈øes; de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them withal, to quicken their Levies for <hi>Munster,</hi> and <hi>Connaught,</hi> as the <hi>Scots</hi> already did theirs of <hi>Ul≈øter;</hi> and offers his Per≈øon again≈øt the Rebels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament having for ≈øome time mi≈øtru≈øted the Kings going <hi>North,</hi> to be intended for ≈øeizing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66116:54"/>the Magazine at <hi>Hull,</hi> endeavoured to prevent it, declaring their ≈øu≈øpicion of his de≈øign to rai≈øe an Army, and therefore pray, <q>That it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as a place of more ≈øafety, and ea≈øier tran≈øport for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and that the Repreive for the popi≈øh prie≈øts in <hi>Newgate</hi> may be recalled and they executed.</q> And to make all ≈øure, Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Hou≈øe of Commons, is ≈øent down to take upon him the Government of that place, who by his ≈øudden coming thither, prevented the Earl of <hi>New-ca≈øtle,</hi> who was de≈øigned by the King to be Governor thereof; ≈øo that when the King came to <hi>Hull</hi> in Per≈øon, with his Guard con≈øi≈øting of Lords and Gentlemen, <hi>April</hi> 23. 1642, he finds the Gates ≈øhut upon him, and the Bridges drawn up; but from the Wall <hi>Hotham</hi> appears, and upon his knees intreats his Maje≈øty, <hi>Not to command that, which, without the breach of his Tru≈øt, he could not yeild obedience to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the King finding his entrance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, cau≈øed <hi>Hotham</hi> in≈øtantly to be proclaimed Traytor; and by Letters to the Parliament, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of that Indignity, and required ≈øatisfaction; but they ju≈øtified him therein, and ≈øent a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the Lords and Commons to re≈øide there, for the better ≈øecuring the Garri≈øon to them, and gave the Governor power to rai≈øe the Trained Bands for his defence; after which the King hearing that the Parliament had rai≈øed a Guard of them≈øelves without his con≈øent; and reflecting upon the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs of <hi>Hotham,</hi> he ≈øummoned the Gentry of <hi>York≈øhire</hi> to a Meeting, and acquainted them, <q>That his Magazine at <hi>Hull</hi> was going to be taken from him again≈øt his will, the <hi>Militia</hi> again≈øt the Law and his con≈øent, put in execution, and Sir

                  <hi>John Hothams</hi> Trea≈øon countenanced, ≈øo that he was re≈øolved to have a Guard to ≈øecure his per≈øon, in which he de≈øired their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, that he might be able to protect them, the Laws, and the true Prote≈øtant Religion, from violation or injury.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King had hereby indifferently ≈øtrengthened him≈øelf, and more had come in had not tho≈øe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, who came to the King at <hi>York,</hi> prevailed with ≈øome of the Free-holders to prote≈øt again≈øt it.

            <p>In the mean while Sir <hi>Thomas Gardiner,</hi> who had been Recorder of <hi>London</hi> for ≈øix years, being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached by the Parliament, and in danger of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was glad to ≈øhift for him≈øelf, and by flight e≈øcaped to the King; at which time his Maje≈øty endeavoured to have removed the Term from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> but was much oppo≈øed therein by the Parliament, who Voted it Illegal, and forbid the L.

The Parliament now proceed to put the people into a Military po≈øture, requiring all Per≈øons in Authority to put the late Ordinance of the <hi>Militia</hi> in Execution, which the King by his Proclamation forbids; but for the Peoples ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the Parliament publi≈øh'd a ≈øevere Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ≈øame Effect as their former Remon≈øtrance; only this was added, <q>That the King at his being in <hi>Scotland</hi> had countenanced the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious

            </p>
            <p>The King makes a ≈øpeedy An≈øwer hereunto, not much differing from what he had ≈øaid before; yet tells them, <q>That as to the bu≈øine≈øs of the <hi>Iri≈øh,</hi> his Council in <hi>Ireland</hi> had de≈øired them no ≈øooner, nor ≈øo many Copies by twenty as he had Signed and and ≈øent them.

            <p>The≈øe propo≈øitions were rejected by the King, as incon≈øi≈øtent with his Regality: ≈øo that now Men began to di≈øpair of any good i≈ø≈øue, for both ≈øides make preparations for War: The King ≈øending out his <hi>Commi≈ø≈øions of Array;</hi> and the Parliament publi≈øhed an Order <hi>June</hi> 10. for bringing in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or plate to maintain the Hor≈øe, Hor≈øe-men, and Arms, for the publick peace and defence of the King and both Hou≈øes of Parliament; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Kings <hi>Commi≈ø≈øion</hi> to be again≈øt the Law, Liberty and property of the Subject; and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors therein to be di≈øturbers of the peace, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the Subjects Liberty. At this time the Lord keeper <hi>Littleton,</hi> having delivered the Great Seal to one <hi>Eliot,</hi> whom the King ≈øent for it, dur≈øt not ≈øtay behind for fear of being que≈øtioned, but went to the King to <hi>York,</hi> as many of the Peers did likewi≈øe whom the King ≈øummoning together, as al≈øo his Privy Council, he declares and prote≈øts to them, <q>That he would not U≈øurp any Illegal Authority over them, but is ready to maintain them again≈øt all others that would. And that he would defend them from all Votes and Orders of Parliament, together with the true <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, the lawful Liberty of the Subject, and the ju≈øt Priviledges of the Three E≈øtates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor will he Engage them in any War but what ≈øhall be for the nece≈ø≈øary defence of his and their rights;</q> Whereupon they all ingaged to him their Duty and Allegiance in a mo≈øt Solemn-Prote≈øtation,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66116:58"/>After which the King ≈øent Letters to Sir <hi>Rich. Gurney</hi> L.

            <p>At this time the King publi≈øheth a General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, wherein he de≈øcants upon all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Declarations for the la≈øt 7 Months, but e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the la≈øt; profe≈ø≈øing that hence forward he expects they ≈øhould break out into di≈øloyal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, declaims again≈øt their making the defence of the King, to be the pretence for their rai≈øing Forces; prote≈øts his own con≈øtant Re≈øolution for the pre≈øerving of Peace, Religion, the Laws and Subjects Liberties, and expects all his Subjects to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him again≈øt the Traiterous Attempts of ≈øuch Men as would de≈øtroy his Per≈øon, Honour, and E≈øtate, and bring on a Civil War; engaging that who≈øoever ≈øhall bring to him Money, Ammunition, Hor≈øe, or Arms, ≈øhall receive Eight Pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> Con≈øideration, and have good A≈ø≈øurance of both Principal and Intere≈øt, upon his Forre≈øt Lands, Parks, and Hou≈øes.</p>
            <p>After this the King by Proclamation forbids all Levies of Forces, and all Contributions to ≈øuch Levies, without his expre≈øs plea≈øure; grounding it upon ≈øeveral Statutes as 7 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. And then minds them of their Oath of Allegiance, by which they were bound to be Faithful, not to the King only as King, but to his Per≈øon, as King <hi>Charles,</hi> contrary to the Parliaments di≈øtinction, betwixt his Per≈øon and his Authority; his Per≈øon at <hi>York,</hi> and his Authority in Parliament; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes

            <p>After this the King makes a Progre≈øs from <hi>York</hi> into the Counties of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and Summons the Gentlemen and Freeholders to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark,</hi> he Care≈ø≈øes them with the mo≈øt obliging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions imaginable.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66116:59"/>nece≈ø≈øary to get the Fleet into their hands, they found means, notwith≈øtanding the Oppo≈øitions of Sir <hi>J.

            <p>The Parliament now thought fit to Arm, and therefore re≈øolve that an Army ≈øhall be rai≈øed for Defence (as they term it) of King and Parliament; and the Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> to be Capt.

            <p>The King was likewi≈øe furni≈øhed with Money from the Queen upon the pawned Jewels, and ≈øome Contributions from divers Lords and Gentlemen, and the Univer≈øity of <hi>Oxford.</hi> The King goes from <hi>Beverly</hi> to <hi>Leicester,</hi> and there Proclaims the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> Traitor, for removing the County <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine</hi> from the Town to his own Hou≈øe at <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.

            <p>A while after Collonel <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Sands</hi> were rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Worce≈øter</hi> by Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> while they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to take the Town from Sir <hi>John Byron,</hi> who had it in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion for the King; but <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> making his approach with his Army, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Byron</hi> quitted the Town to him; then were <hi>Gloce≈øter, Bri≈øtol</hi> and other places made Garri≈øons for the Parliament; But in <hi>York-≈øhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> the Kings Party grew powerfull, and likewi≈øe in <hi>Wales;</hi> where the E. of <hi>Worce≈øter</hi> had got together a great number of <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> ≈øo that the King ≈øeeing his Army increa≈øed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to march toward <hi>London,</hi> and was gotten one dayes Journey before <hi>E≈ø≈øex;</hi> who perceiving his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of ≈øtaying ≈øo long at <hi>Worce≈øter,</hi> ha≈øtens after him, to the relief of his Ma≈øters; the King di≈ødaining to be pur≈øued by a Subject, turns back to meer him, and <hi>October</hi> 23. 1642. both Parties drew into the Field between <hi>Keinton</hi> and <hi>Edghill</hi> in <hi>Warwick-≈øhire,</hi> where on both ≈øides were ≈ølain between five and 6000. men that day, but night parting them, the next day both parties quit the Field; the King then marches to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi> and from thence ≈øends a Proclamation of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> ≈øome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons only excepted.

            <p>The King then takes in <hi>Banbury,</hi> the Town and Ca≈øtle being ≈øurrendred without a blow, and two Regiments of Foot, and a Troop of Hor≈øe, took Arms under him; from thence the King marches to <hi>Oxford;</hi> and <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> goes to <hi>London,</hi> where he was received with great Honour; The Parliament to

            <p>At this time a Letter from one of the Kings Agents

            <p>The Parliament, <hi>Febr.</hi> 1. make the following Prepo≈øitions to the King at <hi>Oxford</hi> (which were pre≈øented by the Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Pembrook,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> with 8. of the Hou≈øe of Commons.) <hi>To disband his Army, and to return home to his Parliament; To leave all Delinquents to Tryal, and all</hi> Papi≈øts <hi>to be di≈øarmed: To pa≈øs an Act for Aboli≈øhing the pre≈øent Church Governors, and ≈øuch other Bills as ≈øhall be prepared</hi> in order to a Reformation; <hi>All</hi> Popi≈øh Recu≈øants <hi>to abjure and renounce</hi> Popery; <hi>All Malignant Councellors to be removed, the</hi> Militia <hi>to be ≈øetled according to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments minds; ≈øuch Per≈øons to be preferr'd to Great Offices and Places of Judicature, as the Parliament ≈øhall name, and all ≈øuch Ju≈øtices of Peace as have been lately turned out of Commi≈ø≈øion to be again taken in;</hi> That an Act pa≈øs to <hi>Vindicate the L.</hi> Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolton, and <hi>the</hi> 5 <hi>Members.

            <p>On the other ≈øide, the King Propo≈øed, <q>That his own Revenue, Magazines, Towns, Ships, and Forts be re≈øtored: That what hath been done contrary to Law, and the King Rights, may be renounced, and recalled: That all Illegal Power claimed, or acted by any Orders of Parliament, be di≈øclaimed; And as the King will readily con≈øent to the Execution of all Laws made or to be made concerning Popery, and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øo he de≈øires a Bill for the pre≈øerving the <hi>Book of Common-Prayer</hi> again≈øt Sectaries; And that all Per≈øons excepted again≈øt in the Treaty, may be Tryed <hi>per Pares</hi> by the Equals: That there be a Ce≈ø≈øation of Arms, and a Free Trade.</q>

            <p>This made way for a Treaty of Peace, but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was done in it till <hi>March</hi> 4. 1642. when Sir <hi>Ben.

            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. 1642. The Queen landed at <hi>Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Key,</hi> with Officers, Ammunition and Mony from <hi>Holland,</hi> from whence the E. of <hi>Montro≈øs,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> conveyed her to <hi>York,</hi> where ≈øhe was honourably received by the Earls of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Newca≈øtle,</hi> and there ≈øhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to form her Army. In the mean time Coll. <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey</hi> advances again≈øt Capt. <hi>Bridges,</hi> who kept <hi>Sudly Ca≈øtle</hi> in <hi>Gloce≈øter≈øhire,</hi> with 60 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and all other things ≈øufficient, for the L. <hi>Shandois</hi> on the Kings behalf; Coll. <hi>Ma≈ø≈øy</hi> offers to ≈øtorm the Ca≈øtle, but is repul≈øed, yet next day he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the Garden under the Ca≈øtle, and firing ≈øome hay and ≈øtraw, made ≈øo great

            <p>Yet had the Parliament no great cau≈øe of boa≈øting of this Victory; For ≈øoon after <hi>P.

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Worce≈øter</hi> and his ≈øon the L. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> had now rai≈øed an Army of near 1500 <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> for the King, with whom he marched to the Forre≈øt of <hi>Dean,</hi> and beat Coll. <hi>Bourroughs</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of a ≈ømall Town call'd <hi>Coford</hi> near <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth;</hi> from thence they march to <hi>Hingham</hi> within 2 miles of <hi>Gloce≈øter,</hi> and Coll. <hi>Bret,</hi> demands the Town for the King, but was an≈øwered with ≈øcorn; for <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey</hi> with a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from Capt. <hi>Fines</hi> at <hi>Bri≈øtol,</hi> weakned them with continual Shirmi≈øhes, till Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> having taking <hi>Malmsbury</hi> came to <hi>Gloce≈øter,</hi> and joyned his Forces with the other, ≈øo that this <hi>Welch</hi> Army ≈øpent near five weeks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any Memorable Action.</p>
            <p>But now Coll. <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey</hi> draws out all his Hor≈øe, with 500 Foot, and ≈øome Ordnance, and held them play the fir≈øt day; the next morning the great. Guns give the Alarum, and both Parties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66116:64"/>very fiercely, and the <hi>Welch</hi> were like to have routed him, and taken his Ordnance, at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> comes in to <hi>Ma≈ø≈øeys</hi> a≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, who taking courage thereby they run fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly upon the <hi>Welchmen,</hi> and drive them back to <hi>Hingham</hi> hou≈øe, which they began pre≈øently to batter with their Cannon; whereupon the <hi>Welch</hi> found a Parley, and ≈øurrender the Place, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves Pri≈øoners, but the Officers were to receive Quarter according to their Qualities; and next day <hi>Waller</hi> and <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey</hi> led their booty in Triumph to <hi>Gloce≈øter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the <hi>Scots</hi> had been formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired by the Parliament, which (notwith≈øtanding their late Prote≈øtations not to take Arms again≈øt their Prince,) they now hearken to, and having compleated their Army, <hi>March</hi> 13. 1641. they cro≈øs the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> and march <hi>Southward,</hi> to imploy the E. of <hi>Newca≈øtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Rebels about this time (notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the defeats they met with at <hi>Tredagh</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk</hi>) were much increa≈øed in number; And the the Pope (a more unhappy Fi≈øher, than his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Predece≈ø≈øor St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was for ≈øaving, but he for de≈øtroying men) ≈øends two Letters to them, one ≈øub≈øcribed to <hi>Owen Oneal,</hi> and the other to all Archbi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops, Nobles and People of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in both which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends tho≈øe who had already appeared in the Quarrel, and exhorts others to engage in the ≈øame, declaring his great Joy for their late Butcheries, and Ma≈ø≈øacres upon the <hi>Prote≈øtants,</hi> and be≈øtowing upon them his Fatherly Benediction, and Plenary Pardon and Ab≈øolution for whatever Villanies they had committed. By the Popes thus publickly declaring him≈øelf for them, the Rebels grew very powerful,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66116:64"/>and many who were at fir≈øt afraid of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, now openly appeared for them, in≈øomuch that all parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> were overwhelmed by them as with an Innundation.</p>
            <p>This year was remarkable for the death of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Richlieu</hi> that great Firebrand and di≈øturber of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> but more pertcularly the≈øe three Kingdoms, of who≈øe di≈øtractions he was both a Principal cau≈øer, and Fomenter; He led the way to his Ma≈øter <hi>Lewis</hi> 13. who decea≈øed ≈øoon after in the mid≈øt of his Conque≈øts in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> leaving for his ≈øucce≈ø≈øer his elde≈øt ≈øon <hi>Lewis</hi> 14.

            <p>The year 1643. and the nineteenth of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øties Reign, began with a Treaty of Peace, which was formerly agreed on, but proceeded ≈ølowly, till it was again revived by Sir <hi>Ben.

            <p>
               <hi>That as ≈øoon as he was ≈øatisfied concerning his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, Magazines, Ships and Forces, in which he de≈øired nothing but his Ju≈øt and Legal known Rights to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtored to him, and to Per≈øons Tru≈øted by him; And as ≈øoon as the Members of both Hou≈øes ≈øhould be re≈øtored to the ≈øame capacity of ≈øitting and Voting in Parliament as they had upon</hi> January 1. 1641. <hi>(excluding ≈øuch who≈øe Votes had been taken away by Bill, or by New Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or New Writts:) And that as ≈øoon as his Maje≈øty and both Hou≈øes may be ≈øecured from ≈øuch Tumultuous A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemblies as to the High di≈øhonour of the Parliament had

            </p>
            <p>Upon this Me≈ø≈øage the Parliament re≈øolved to call back their Commi≈ø≈øioners, and ≈øo <hi>April</hi> 15. the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ended; About the beginning of la≈øt <hi>March</hi> the L. <hi>Brook</hi> marched toward <hi>Northampton,</hi> and ≈øeizing the Ammunition there he went from thence to <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and ≈øo to <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> and beat Coll. <hi>Crockers,</hi> and Lt.

At this time Judge <hi>Berkley</hi> who had been impri≈øoned by the Parliament about <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,</hi> was fined Twenty thou≈øand pound, made incapable of all Offices, and to continue a Pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner during plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>The Parliament were now bu≈øied for recruiting Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>'s Army, and to incline the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> to a more chearfull compliance, <hi>Pennington</hi> the L.

            <p>
               <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi> was the place which ≈øtopt the current of the Kings ≈øucce≈ø≈øes; <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey</hi> was Governour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and had with him two Regiments of Foot, and an 100 Hor≈øe, which with ≈øome other Recruits made up 1500 men, with forty Barels of Powder, and a ≈ølender Artillery; yet they within behaved them≈øelves like men of Re≈øolution, and Allarum'd the Be≈øiegers with frequent Sallies; The King plants his Cannon again≈øt the Gates, which made above 150 ≈øhot, and the Granadoes did ≈øome Execution in the Town, yet nothing abated the Spirits of the People. Whereupon the King prepares for a General Storm, and all was ready, they within being in want and having but three Barrels of Powder left, when news comes that <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> was on his March with a powerfull Army to rai≈øe the Siege; whereupon after con≈øulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66116:68"/>had by the King with the General Officers, it was re≈øolved, the Kings Army ≈øhould draw off, which was done, and all their Hutts were ≈øet on fire, and <hi>Sept.</hi> 5. 1643. <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> enters into <hi>Gloce≈øter,</hi> and having furni≈øhed the City plentifully with provi≈øions, went after the King, who at that Siege lo≈øt that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of marching up to <hi>London</hi> (the Parliament having then no con≈øiderable Army in the Field) which he could never regain.</p>
            <p>The War had hitherto continued in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Army had commonly ≈øucce≈øs again≈øt the Rebels, but the King now under≈øtanding the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contracting with the <hi>Scots</hi> for aid; thought fit to ≈øtrengthen him≈øelf by recalling part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there, hither; and commi≈ø≈øionated the E. of <hi>Ormond</hi> his Lieut.

            <p>The E. of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> having relieved <hi>Gloce≈øter,</hi> ≈øpeeds after the King, and pa≈ø≈øing by <hi>Cirence≈øter</hi> left a ≈øtrong Party there, where P. <hi>Maurice</hi> was expected that night; but in≈øtead of him, comes <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> and being mi≈øtaken for the other, enters the Town without any Oppo≈øition, ≈øeizes 400 men, and 30 Cart loads of Provi≈øion, and then marches to <hi>Newberry</hi> where the King was before, and had gotten the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Ground, and planted his Ordnance; Early in the morning, <hi>Sept.</hi> 20. 1643. <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> views the Kings Army, and in <hi>Newberry</hi> Common draws up his own, and falls to firing, the Kings Army doing the like; That part of the Army which P. <hi>Rupert</hi> charged, being overlay'd, were forced to fall off on the Right hand, where two Great
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66116:68"/>Bodies of Hor≈øe marched down the Hill, and fell in furiou≈øly upon the Prince; both ≈øides acting with great valour and fury, and coming to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-≈øtrokes with their Swords.</p>
            <p>The <hi>E≈ø≈øexians</hi> then wheeling about charged the L. <hi>Jermins</hi> Regiment, whom they forced to make their e≈øcape through ≈øome Bodies of Foot; this Battel cau≈øed great lo≈øs and blood≈øhed on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide, but greater on the Kings, who≈øe other Bodies of Hor≈øe commanded by the Earls of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narvan,</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> notwith≈øtanding the great courage of their Commanders were overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Earls of <hi>Carnarvan</hi> and <hi>Sunderland,</hi> Vi≈øcount <hi>Falkland</hi> and many other Officers and Gentlemen ≈ølain; The <hi>London</hi> Trained Bunds and Auxiliaries did the Parliament great ≈øervice in this Fight; Night coming on, both Armies retired, and next day marched away from each other.</p>
            <p>After this, ≈øeveral Places were Garri≈øoned for the King by Sir <hi>William Vava≈øor,</hi> as <hi>Tewksbury, Shudley</hi> Ca≈øtle and other places in <hi>Gloce≈øter-≈øhire,</hi> and ≈øoon after <hi>Waller</hi> again ≈øurpri≈øeth <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> but is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward beaten by P. <hi>Maurice.

Now I would know by what Authority, I mean, lawful; there are many unlawful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the world, Thieves and Robbers by the high wayes; but I would know by what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I was brought from thence, and carried from place to place, (and I know not what;) and when I know by what lawful Authority, I ≈øhall an≈øwer: Remember I am your King, and what ≈øins you bring upon your heads, and the Judgment of God upon this Land, think well upon it, I ≈øay, think well upon it, before you go further from one ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a greater, therefore let me know by what law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority I am ≈øeated here, and I ≈øhall not be unwilling to an≈øwer; in the mean time I ≈øhall not betray my Tru≈øt.

I do not come here as ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the Court; I will ≈øtand as much for the Priviledge of the Hou≈øe of Commons, rightly under≈øtood, as any man here what≈øoever. I ≈øee no Hou≈øe of Lords here that may con≈øtitute a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and (the King too) ≈øhould have been. Is this the bringing of the King to his Parliament? Is this the bringing an end to the Treaty in the publick Faith of the world? Let me ≈øee a legal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority warranted by the Word of God, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or warranted by the Con≈øtitutions of the Kingdom, and I will an≈øwer.</q>

                  <q>Sir, I de≈øire that you would give me, and all the world, ≈øatisfaction in this; let me tell you; it is not a ≈ølight thing you are about. I am ≈øworn to keep the Peace by that duty I owe to God and my Country, and I will do it to the la≈øt breath of my body, and therefore you ≈øhall do well to ≈øatifie fir≈øt God, and then the Country, by what Authority
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66116:80"/>you do it; if you do it by a u≈øurped Authority, that will not la≈øt long. There is a God in Heaven that will call you, and all that give you power, to account: Satisfie me in that, and I will an≈øwer, otherwi≈øe I betray my tru≈øt, and the Liberties of the People, and therefore think of that, and then I ≈øhall be willing. For I do avow, that it is as great a ≈øin to with≈øtand lawful Authority, as it is to ≈øubmit to a Tyrannical, or any other wayes unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority; and therefore ≈øatisfie God, and me, and all the World in that, and you ≈øhall receive my An≈øwer: I am not afraid of the Bill.</q>

               <hi>Two things were remarkable in this dayes proceedings.</hi>

            <p n="1" rend="small">1. It is ob≈øerved, That as the Charge was reading again≈øt the King, the ≈øilver head of his Staff fell off, the which he wondered at, and ≈øeeing none to take it up, he ≈øtoop'd for it him≈øelf, and put it in his pocket.</p>

            <p n="2" rend="small">2.

               <p>O Yes made: Silence commanded, The Court called, and an≈øwered to their Names.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Solicitor.</hi> May it plea≈øe your Lord≈øhip, my Lord Pre≈øident, I did at the la≈øt Court in the behalf of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> exhibit and give into this Court a Charge of High Trea≈øon and other high Crimes, again≈øt the Pri≈øoner at the Bar, whereof I do accu≈øe him in the name of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> and the Charge was read unto

My humble Motion to this High Court, in behalf of the People of <hi>England,</hi> is, That the Pri≈øoner may be directed to make a po≈øitive An≈øwer, either by way of Confe≈ø≈øion or Negation; which if he ≈øhall refu≈øe to do, that the matter of.

                  <speaker>Pre≈øident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, You may remember at the la≈øt Court, you were told the occa≈øion of your being brought hither, and you heard a Charge again≈øt you, containing a Charge of high Trea≈øon, and other high Crimes, again≈øt this Realm of <hi>England;</hi> you heard likewi≈øe that it was prayed in the behalf of the People, that you ≈øhould give an an≈øwer to that Charge, that thereupon ≈øuch proceedings might be had, as ≈øhould be agreeable to ju≈øtice; you were then plea≈øed to make ≈øome ≈øcruples concerning the Authority of this Court, and knew not by what Authority you were brought hither; you did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times propound your Que≈øtions, and were as often an≈øwered, that it was by Authority of the <hi>Commons of England a≈ø≈øembled in Parliament,</hi> that did think fit to call you to an account for tho≈øe high and capital mi≈ødemeanours wherewith you were then charged. Since that, the Court hath taken into Con≈øideration what you then ≈øaid; they are fully ≈øatisfied with their own Authority, and they hold it fit you ≈øhould ≈øtand ≈øatisfied with it too; and they do require it, that you do give a po≈øitive and particular An≈øwer to this Charge that is exhibited again≈øt you, they do expect you ≈øhould either confe≈øs or deny it; if you deny, it is offered in the behalf of the Nation to be made good again≈øts
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66116:81"/>you; their Authority they do avow to the whole world, that the whole Kingdom are to re≈øt ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in, and you are to re≈øt ≈øatisfied with it, and therefore you are to lo≈øe no more time, but to give a po≈øitive An≈øwer thereunto.</p>

                  <q>
                     <p>When I was here la≈øt, 'tis true, I made that Que≈øtion, and truly if it were onely my own particular ca≈øe, I would have ≈øatisfied my ≈øelf with the Prote≈øtation I made the la≈øt time I was here again≈øt the Legality of this Court, and that a King cannot be tryed by any Superiour Juri≈ødiction on Earth; but it is not my ca≈øe alone, it is the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and the Liberty of the people of <hi>England;</hi> and do you pretend what you will, I ≈øtand more for their Liberties. For if power without Law, may make Laws, may alter the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, I do not know what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he is in <hi>England,</hi> that can be ≈øure of his life, or any thing that he calls his own; therefore when that I came here, I did expect particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons to know by what Law, what Authority you did proceed again≈øt me here, and therefore I am a little to ≈øeek what to ≈øay to you in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, becau≈øe the Affirmative is proved, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative often is very hard to do: but ≈øince I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not per≈øwade you to do it, I ≈øhall tell you my Rea≈øons as ≈øhort as I can.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is now the third time that by the great grace, and favour of this High Court, the Pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath been brought to the Bar, before any I≈ø≈øue joyned in the Cau≈øe. My Lord, I did at the fir≈øt Court exhibit a Charge again≈øt him, containing the highe≈øt Trea≈øon that ever was wrought upon the Theatre of <hi>England:</hi> that a King of <hi>England,</hi> tru≈øted to keep the Law, That had taken an Oath ≈øo to do, That had Tribute paid him for that end, ≈øhould be guilty of a wicked de≈øign to ≈øubvert and de≈øtroy our Lawes, and introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in the defiance of the Parliament and their Authority, ≈øet up his Standard for War again≈øt his Parliament and People; and I did
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66116:85"/>humbly pray, in the behalf of the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> that he might ≈øpeedily be required to make an an≈øwer to the Charge.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, in≈øtead of making any An≈øwer, he did then di≈øpute the Authority of this High Court; your Lord≈øhip was plea≈øed to give him a further day to con≈øider, and to put in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, which day being ye≈øterday, I did humbly move that he might be required to give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and po≈øitive an≈øwer, either by denying, or confe≈ø≈øion of it; but (my Lord) he was then plea≈øed for to demurre to the Juri≈ødiction of the Court, which the Court did then overrule, and command him to give a direct and po≈øitive An≈øwer. My Lord, be≈øides this great delay of, Ju≈øtice, I ≈øhall now humbly move your Lord≈øhip for ≈øpeedy Judgment again≈øt him. My Lord, I might pre≈ø≈øe your Lord≈øhip upon the whole, That according to the known Rules of the Law of the Land, That if a Pri≈øoner ≈øhall ≈øtand as contumacious in contempt, and ≈øhall not put in an i≈ø≈øuable plea, Guilty or not Guilty of the Charge given again≈øt him, whereby he may come to a fair Tryal; That as by an implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion, it may be taken <hi>pro confe≈ø≈øo,</hi> as it hath been done to tho≈øe who have de≈øerved more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than the Pri≈øoner at the Bar has done: but be≈øides, my Lord, I ≈øhall humbly pre≈ø≈øe your Lord≈øhip upon the whole Fact; the Hou≈øe of Commons, the Supream Authority and Juri≈ødicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kingdom, they have declared, That it is notorious, That the matter of the Charge is true, as it is in truth (my Lord) as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chry≈øtal, and as the Sun that ≈øhines at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; which if your Lord≈øhip and the Court be not ≈øatisfied in, I have notwith≈øtanding, on the

You were told over and over again, That the Court did affirm their own juri≈ødiction: That it was not for you, nor any other man, to di≈øpute the <hi>Juri≈ødiction of the Supreme and highe≈øt Authority of</hi> England, from which there is no Appeal, and touching which there mu≈øt be no di≈øpute; yet you did per≈øi≈øt in ≈øuch carriage, as you gave no manner of obedience, nor did you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Authority in them, nor the <hi>High Court, that con≈øtituted this Court of Ju≈øtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, I mu≈øt let you know from the Court, That they are very ≈øen≈øible of the≈øe delays of yours, and that they ought not, being thus Authorized by the ≈øupreme <hi>Court of England,</hi> to be thus trifled withall, and that they might in ju≈øtice, if they plea≈øed, and according to the Rules of Ju≈øtice, take advantage of the≈øe delayes, and proceed to pronounce judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again≈øt you; yet neverthele≈øs they are plea≈øed to give direction, and on their behalfs I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you, that you make a po≈øitive An≈øwer unto this Charge that is again≈øt you: Sir, in plain terms; for Ju≈øtice knows no re≈øpect of per≈øons, you are to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66116:86"/>give your po≈øitive and final An≈øwer in plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh,</hi> whether you be guilty or not guilty of the≈øe Trea≈øons laid to your Charge.</p>

                  <p>Sir you have had the Re≈øolution of the Court upon the like Que≈øtion the la≈øt day, and you were told, That having ≈øuch a Charge of ≈øo high a Nature again≈øt you, your Work was, that you ought to acknowledge the juri≈ødiction of the Court, <hi>and to An≈øwer to your Charge.</hi> Sir, if you An≈øwer to your Charge, which the Court gives you leave now to do, though they might have taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of your Contempt, yet if you be able to An≈øwer to your Charge, when you have once An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, you ≈øhall be heard at large, make the be≈øt Defence you can. But Sir, I mu≈øt let you know from the Court, as their commands, that you are not to be permitted to i≈ø≈øue out into any other di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes, till ≈øuch time as you have given a po≈øitive An≈øwer concerning the <hi>Matter</hi> that is <hi>Charged</hi> upon you.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66116:88"/>and brought before the Court to make an≈øwer to a Charge of Trea≈øon and other high Crimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited again≈øt him in the Name of the People of <hi>England;</hi> to which Charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required to An≈øwer,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Here an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lady inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Court, ≈øaying,</hi> Not half the People, <hi>but ≈øhe was ≈øoon ≈øilenced.</hi>
                     </note> he hath been ≈øo far from obeying the Commands of the Court, by ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to their Ju≈øtice, as he began to take upon him to offer rea≈øoning and debate unto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Court, and of the highe≈øt Court that con≈øtituted them to try and judge him; but being over-ruled in that, and required to make his An≈øwer, he was ≈øtill plea≈øed to continue contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to refu≈øe to ≈øubmit or An≈øwer: Hereupon the Court, that they may not be wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, to the tru≈øt repo≈øed in them, nor that any mans wilfulne≈øs prevent Ju≈øtice, they have thought fit to take the matter into their con≈øideration; They have con≈øidered of the Contumacy, and of that confe≈ø≈øion which in Law doth ari≈øe upon that contumacy; They have likewi≈øe con≈øidered of the notoriety of the Fact charged upon the Pri≈øoner, and upon the whole matter they are re≈øolved, and have agreed upon a Sentence to be now pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced again≈øt this Pri≈øoner: but in re≈øpect he doth de≈øire to be heard before the Sentence be read and pronounced, the Court hath re≈øolved that they will hear him; yet Sir, thus much I mu≈øt tell you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, which you have been minded of at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts; that if that you have to ≈øay be to offer any Debate concerning juri≈ødiction, you are not to be heard in it, you have offered it formerly, and you have indeed ≈øtruck at the root, that is, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and <hi>Supreme Authority of the Commons of England,</hi> which this Court will not admit a debate of, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66116:88"/>which indeed is an irrational thing in them to do, being a Court that acts upon Authority denived from them, that they ≈øhould pre≈øume to judge upon their Superiority, from whom there is no Appeal. But Sir, if you have any thing to ≈øay in defence of your ≈øelf concerning the matters charged, the Court hath given me command to let you know they will hear you.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>Since that I ≈øee that you will not hear any thing of debate concerning that which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs I thought mo≈øt material for the peace of the Kingdom, and for the Liberty of the Subject, I ≈øhall wave it, I ≈øhall ≈øpeak nothing to it; but only I mu≈øt tell you, That this many a day all things have been taken away from me, but that, that I call more dear to me than my life, which is <hi>My Con≈øcience and my Honour;</hi> and if I had re≈øpect to my life more than the Peace of the Kingdom, the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> certainly I ≈øhould have made a particular defence for my ≈øelf, for by that at lea≈øt-wi≈øe I might have delayed an ugly Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which I believe will pa≈øs upon me; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly, Sir, as a man that hath ≈øome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, ≈øome knowledge of the world, if that my true zeal to my Countrey had not overborn the care that I have of my own pre≈øervation, I ≈øhould have gone another way to work than that I have done: Now Sir, I conceive that an ha≈øtie Sentence once pa≈øt, may be ≈øooner repented than recalled: And truly the ≈øelf ≈øame de≈øire that I have for <hi>the Peace of the Kingdome, and the Liberty of the Subject, more than my own particular,</hi> does make me now at la≈øt de≈øire, That having ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for to ≈øay that concerns both, I de≈øire before Sentence be given, that I may be heard in the Painted Chamber before the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66116:89"/>this delay cannot be prejudicial to you what≈øoever I ≈øay, if that I ≈øay no Rea≈øon, tho≈øe that hear me mu≈øt be Judges, I cannot be Judge of that that I have; if it be Rea≈øon, and really for the <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject,</hi> I am ≈øure on it very well, it is worth the hearing; Therefore I do conjure you, as you love that you pretend, I hope it is real, <hi>the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Peace of the Kingdom;</hi> that you will grant Me the hearing, before any Sentence be pa≈ø≈øed; I only de≈øire this, that you will take this into your con≈øideration, it may be you have not heard of it before-hand; if you will, I'le retire, and you may think of it: but if I cannot get this <hi>Liberty,</hi> I do here prote≈øt, that ≈øo fair ≈øhews of <hi>Liberty and Peace</hi> are pure ≈øhews, and not otherwi≈øe, then that you will not hear your KING.</q>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66116:90"/>you, and notwith≈øtanding what you have offered, they are re≈øolved to proceed to puni≈øhment, and to Judgment, and that is their unanimous re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>

                  <p>The Court then Sir, hath ≈øomething to ≈øay unto you, which although I know it will be very unacceptable, yet notwith≈øtanding they are willing, and are re≈øolved to di≈øcharge their Duty.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you ≈øpeak very well of a precious thing that you call Peace, and it had been much to be wi≈øhed that God had put it into your heart, that you had as effectually and really endeavoured and ≈øtudied the Peace of the Kingdom, as now in words you ≈øeem to pretend; but as you were told the other day, <hi>Actions mu≈øt expound Intentions,</hi> yet Actions have been clean contrary; and truly Sir, it doth appear plainly enough to them, that you have gone upon very erroneous principles; the Kingdom hath felt it to their ≈ømart, and it will be no ea≈øe to you to think of it; for Sir, you have held your ≈øelf, and let fall ≈øuch Language, as if you had been no wayes ≈øubject to the Law, or that the Law had not been your Superiour. Sir, the Court is very well ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, and I hope ≈øo are all the under≈øtanding people of <hi>England, That the Law is your Superiour:</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:66116:91"/>That you ought to have ruled according to the Law, you ought to have done ≈øo Sir: I know very well your pretence hath been that you have done ≈øo, but Sir, the difference hath been, who ≈øhall be the <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitors of this Law;</hi> Sir, whether you and your party out of Courts of Ju≈øtice, ≈øhall take upon them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Law, or the <hi>Courts of Ju≈øtice,</hi> who are the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders; nay, the Soveraign and <hi>the High Court of Ju≈øtice,</hi> the <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> who are not onely <hi>the highe≈øt Expounders,</hi> but <hi>the ≈øole Makers of the Law.</hi> Sir, for you to ≈øet your ≈øelf with your ≈øingle judgment, and tho≈øe that adhere unto you, again≈øt <hi>the highe≈øt Court of Ju≈øtice, that is not Law:</hi> Sir, as the Law is your ≈øuperiour, ≈øo truly Sir, there is ≈øomething that is ≈øuperior to the Law, and that is indeed the <hi>Parent or Author</hi> of the Law, and that is <hi>the People of England.</hi> For Sir, as they are tho≈øe that at the fir≈øt, (as other Countreys have done) did chu≈øe to them≈øelves this <hi>Form of Government,</hi> even for Ju≈øtice ≈øake, that Ju≈øtice might be admini≈øtred, that Peace might be pre≈øerved; ≈øo Sir, they gave Laws to their Governors, according to which they ≈øhould govern; and if tho≈øe Laws ≈øhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inconvenient, or prejudicial to the publick, they had a power in them, and re≈øerved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, to alter as they ≈øhould ≈øee cau≈øe. Sir, it is very true, what ≈øome of your ≈øide have ≈øaid, <hi>Rex non habet parem in Regno;</hi> This Court will ≈øay the ≈øame while <hi>King, That you have not your Peer</hi> in ≈øome ≈øence, for you are <hi>Major ≈øingulis,</hi> but they will averr again, that you are <hi>Minor univer≈øis;</hi> and the ≈øame Author tells you, that <hi>in exhibitione juris,</hi> there you have no power, but are <hi>qua≈øi minimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This we know to be Law, <hi>Rex habet ≈øuperiorem, Deum &amp; Legem, etiam &amp; Curiam,</hi> and ≈øo ≈øays the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66116:92"/>≈øame Author; and truly Sir, he makes bold to go a little further, <hi>Debent ei ponere fraenum, They ought to bridle him;</hi> and Sir, we know very well the ≈øtories of old; Tho≈øe Wars that were called the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> when the Nobility of the Land did ≈øtand out <hi>for the Liberty and Property of the Subject,</hi> and would not ≈øuffer the Kings that did invade to play the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants here, but called them to account for it, we know that truth, That they did <hi>fraenum ponere:</hi> But Sir, if they do forbear to do their duty now, and are not ≈øo mindful of their own honour and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms good, certainly the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> will not be unmindful of what is for their pre≈øervation, and for their ≈øafety: <hi>Ju≈øtitiae fruendi cau≈øa Reges con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuti ≈øunt.</hi> This we learn is the end of having Kings, or any other Governours, it's for the enjoying of Ju≈øtice, that's the end. Now Sir, if ≈øo be the King will go contrary to the end of his Government; Sir, he mu≈øt under≈øtand that he is but an Officer of tru≈øt, and he ought to di≈øcharge that tru≈øt, and they are to take order for the animadver≈øion and puni≈øhment of ≈øuch an offending Governour.</p>
                  <p>This is not Law of ye≈øterday, Sir, (≈øince the time of the divi≈øion betwixt you and your People,) but it is Law of old; And we know very well the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> and <hi>Authorities</hi> that do tell us what the Law was in that point upon the Election of Kings, upon the <hi>Oath</hi> that they took unto their People, and if they did not ob≈øerve it, there weere tho≈øe things cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Parliaments; The <hi>Parliaments</hi> were they that were to adjudge (the very words of the <hi>Author</hi>) <hi>the plaints and wrongs done of the King and Queen, or their Children; ≈øuch wrongs e≈øpecially, when the People could have no where el≈øe any remedy.</hi> Sir, that hath been the People of <hi>Englands</hi> ca≈øe, they could not have their remedy el≈øewhere but in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:66116:92"/>
                  <p>Sir, <hi>Parliaments</hi> were ordained for that purpo≈øe, to redre≈øs the grievances of the People, that was their main end; and truly Sir, if ≈øo be that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had been rightly mindful of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, they were never more in <hi>Maje≈øty and State,</hi> than in the <hi>Parliament:</hi> but how forgetfull ≈øome have been, <hi>Hi≈øtories</hi> have told us; We have a mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a lamentable, a ≈øad experience of it. Sir, by the old Laws of <hi>England,</hi> (I ≈øpeak the≈øe things the rather to you, becau≈øe you were plea≈øed to let fall the other day, you thought you had as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Law, as mo≈øt Gentlemen in <hi>England;</hi> it is very well Sir. And truly Sir, it is very good for the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> to under≈øtand that Law under which they mu≈øt live, and by which they mu≈øt be governed. And then Sir, the <hi>Scripture</hi> ≈øays, <hi>They that know their Ma≈øters Will and do it not,</hi> what follows. The Law is your Ma≈øter, the Acts of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>) the <hi>Parliaments</hi> were to be kept anciently, we find in our <hi>Author,</hi> twice in the year, <hi>That the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon any occa≈øion, might have a ready remedy and redre≈ø≈øe for his Grievance.</hi> Afterwards, by ≈øeveral Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> in the dayes of your Predece≈ø≈øor <hi>Edward</hi> the third, they mu≈øt have been once a year. Sir, what intermi≈ø≈øion of PARLIAMENTS hath been in your time, it is very well known, and the ≈øad con≈øequences of it, and what in the interim in≈øtead of the≈øe Parliaments, hath been by you, by an high and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> hand introduced upon the People, that likewi≈øe hath been too well known and felt. But when God by his Providence had ≈øo brought it about, that you could no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the calling of a Parliament; Sir, yet it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what your ends were again≈øt the Ancient, and your Native Kingdom of <hi>Scotland:</hi> The <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:66116:93"/>of <hi>England,</hi> not ≈øerving your ends again≈øt them, you were plea≈øed to di≈ø≈øolve it. Another great nece≈ø≈øity occa≈øioned the calling of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what your de≈øigns and plots and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all along have been for the ruining and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of this Parliament, hath been very noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the whole Kingdom; And truly Sir, in that you did ≈øtrike at all; that had been a ≈øure way to have brought about that that this layes upon you, <hi>Your Intention to ≈øubvert the Fundamental Laws of the Land.</hi> For the great bulwark of <hi>Liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> is the PARLIAMENT of <hi>England;</hi> and to Subvert and Root up that, which your aim hath been to do, certainly at one blow you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Liberties and the Propriety of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, it makes me call to mind, I cannot forbear to expre≈øs it, for Sir, we mu≈øt deal plainly with you, according to the merits of your cau≈øe, ≈øo is our Commi≈ø≈øion; it makes me call to mind (the≈øe proceedings of yours) that we read of a great <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> by the way let us call him <hi>a great Roman Tyrant,</hi> Caligula, <hi>that wi≈øht that the People of</hi> Rome <hi>had had but one Neck, that at one blow he might cut it off:</hi> and your proceedings hath been ≈øomewhat like to this, for the body of the people of <hi>England</hi> hath been (and where el≈øe repre≈øented but) in the Parliament, and could you have but confounded that, you had at one blow cut off the neck of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> but God hath re≈øerved better things for us, and hath plea≈øed for to Confound your de≈øigns, and to break your Forces, and to bring your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon into Cu≈øtodie, that you might be re≈øpon≈øible to Ju≈øtice.</p>
                  <p>Sir, we know very well, That it is a que≈øtion on your ≈øide very much Pre≈øs'd, <hi>By what pre≈øident we
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66116:93"/>≈øhall proceed?</hi> Truly Sir, for <hi>Pre≈øidents,</hi> I ≈øhall not at this pre≈øent make any long di≈øcour≈øe, but it is no new thing to cite <hi>Pre≈øidents</hi> almo≈øt of all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> where the People (when power hath been in their hands) have not ≈øticked to call their Kings to account, and where the change of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> hath en≈øued upon occa≈øions of the <hi>Tyranny and Mi≈ø-government</hi> of tho≈øe that have been placed over them; I will not ≈øpend time to mention <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Empire, or other Countries, Volumes may be written of them; But truly Sir, that of the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> I ≈øhould think ≈øome of us have thought upon it, where they have the Ju≈øtice of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that is a man <hi>tanquam in medio po≈øitus,</hi> betwixt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the people of the Country, that if wrong be done by the King, he that is the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Ju≈øtice hath power to reform the wrong, and he is acknowledged to be the Kings Superiour, and is the grand pre≈øerver of their priviledges, and hath pro≈øecuted Kings upon their mi≈øcarriages.</p>
                  <p>Sir, What the Tribunes of <hi>Rome</hi> were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and what the <hi>Ephori</hi> were to the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian State,</hi> we know that is the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the <hi>Engli≈øh State;</hi> and though <hi>Rome</hi> ≈øeem to have lo≈øt its <hi>liberty</hi> when once the Emperours were, yet you ≈øhall find ≈øome famous Acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice even done by the Senate of <hi>Rome;</hi> that great <hi>Tyrant</hi> of his time, <hi>Nero,</hi> condemned and judged by the <hi>Senate.</hi> But truly Sir, to you I ≈øhould not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the≈øe Forreign examples and ≈øtories. If you look but over <hi>Tweed,</hi> we find enough in your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> If we look to your fir≈øt King <hi>Forgu≈øius,</hi> that your ≈øtories make mention of, he was an Elective King, he died, and left two Sons both in their minority, the Kingdom made choice
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66116:94"/>of their Unkle his Brother to govern in the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; afterwards the Elder Brother giving ≈ømall hopes to the People that he would rule or govern well, ≈øeeking to ≈øupplant that good Unkle of his, that governed them ju≈øtly, they ≈øet the Elder a≈øide, and took to the Younger. Sir, if I ≈øhould come to what your ≈øtories make mention of, you know very well you are the 109th King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for to mention ≈øo many Kings as that Kingdom, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their power and priviledge, have made bold to deal withal, ≈øome to bani≈øh, and ≈øome to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and ≈øome to put to death, it would be too long; and as one of your Authors ≈øayes, it would be too long to recite the manifold examples that your own ≈øtories make mention of; <hi>Reges</hi> (≈øay they) we do create, we created Kings at fir≈øt; <hi>Leges;</hi> &amp;c. We impo≈øed Lawes upon them; and as they are cho≈øen by the ≈øuffrages of the People at the fir≈øt, ≈øo upon ju≈øt occa≈øion, by the ≈øame ≈øuffrages, they may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down again: and we will be bold to ≈øay, that no Kingdom hath yielded more plentiful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than that your Native Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath done, concerning the depo≈øition and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment of their offending and tran≈øgre≈ø≈øing Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not far to go for an example near you, your Grandmother ≈øet a≈øide, and your Father an Infant crowned; and the State did it here in <hi>England;</hi> here hath not been a want of ≈øome examples, they have made bold (the Parliament and the People of <hi>England</hi>) to call their Kings to account, there are frequent examples of it in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, the time before the Conque≈øt; ≈øince the Conque≈øt there wants not ≈øome Pre≈øidents neither; King <hi>Edward</hi> the ≈øecond, King <hi>Richard</hi> the ≈øecond, were dealt with ≈øo by the Parliament, as they were depo≈øed and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66116:94"/>deprived: and truly Sir, whoever ≈øhall look into their ≈øtories, they ≈øhall not find the Articles that are charged upon them to come near to that height and capitalne≈øs of Crimes that are layed to your charge, nothing near.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you were plea≈øed to ≈øay the other day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they de≈øcend, and I did not contradict it, but take altogether: Sir, if you were as the Charge ≈øpeaks, and no otherwi≈øe admitted K. of <hi>England,</hi> but for that you were plea≈øed then to alledge, how that almo≈øt for a thou≈øand years the≈øe things have been, ≈øtories will tell you, if you go no higher than the time of the Conque≈øt; if you do come down ≈øince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt, you are the 24th King from <hi>William</hi> called the Conqueror, you ≈øhall find one half of them to come meerly from the State, and not meerly upon the point of De≈øcent; it were ea≈øie to be in≈øtanced to you, the time mu≈øt not be lo≈øt that way. And truly Sir, what a grave and learned Judge ≈øaid in his time, and well known to you, is ≈øince printed for po≈øterity, <hi>That although there was ≈øuch a thing as a De≈øcent many times, yet the Kings of</hi> England <hi>ever held the greate≈øt a≈ø≈øurance of their titles, when it was declared by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And Sir, your <hi>Oath,</hi> the manner of your <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> doth ≈øhew plainly, That the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and though it's true by the Law the next per≈øon in blood is de≈øigned; yet if there were ju≈øt cau≈øe to refu≈øe him, the people of <hi>England</hi> might do it. For there is a <hi>Contract</hi> and Bargain made between the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi> and your <hi>Oath</hi> is taken, and certainly Sir, the Bond is reciprocal; for as you are the liege Lord, ≈øo they liege Subjects, and we know very well that hath been ≈øo much ≈øpoken of, <hi>Ligan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis e≈øt duplex.</hi> This we know now, the one tye, the one Bond, is the bond of perfection which is due from the Soveraign, the other is the bond of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66116:95"/>that is due from the Subject. Sir, if this bond be once broken, farewel Soveraignty, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectio trahit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe things may not be denyed, Sir; I ≈øpeak it the rather, and I pray God it may work upon your heart, that you may be ≈øen≈øible of your mi≈øcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For whether you have been, as by your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice you ought to be, <hi>a Protector</hi> of England, or <hi>the De≈øtroyer of</hi> England, let all <hi>England</hi> judge, or all the world that hath look'd upon it. Sir, though you have it by <hi>Inheritance</hi> in the way that is ≈øpoken of, yet it mu≈øt not be denyed that your Office was an Office of Tru≈øt, and an Office of the highe≈øt tru≈øt lodged in any ≈øingle per≈øon: For as you were the grand <hi>Admini≈øtrator of Ju≈øtice,</hi> and others were as your <hi>Delegates,</hi> to ≈øee it done throughout your Realms, if your great Office were to do Ju≈øtice, and pre≈øerve your People from wrong, and in≈øtead of doing that, you will be the <hi>great wrong-doer your ≈øelf;</hi> If, in≈øtead of being a <hi>Con≈øervator of the Peace,</hi> you will be <hi>the Grand Di≈øturber of the Peace,</hi> ≈øurely this is contrary to your Office, contrary to your Tru≈øt. Now Sir, if it be an Office of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> as you ≈øpeak of, your Title by <hi>De≈øcent,</hi> let all men know that great Offices are ≈øeizable and forfeitable, as if you had it but for a year, and for your life; Therefore Sir, it will concern you to take into your ≈øerious con≈øideration your great mi≈øcarriages in this kind.</p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, I ≈øhall not particularize the many mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of your Reign what≈øoever, they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou≈øly known, it had been happy for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and happy for you too, if it had not been ≈øo much known and ≈øo much felt, as the ≈øtory of your mi≈øcarriages mu≈øt needs be, and hath been already.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:66116:95"/>
                  <p>Sir, That that we are now upon by the command of the <hi>highe≈øt Court,</hi> hath been and is to Trie and Judge you for great offences of <hi>yours.</hi> Sir, the <hi>Charge</hi> hath called you <hi>Tyrant, a Traytor, a Murtherer, and a publick Enemy to the Common-wealth of</hi> England.

                     </q> and if ≈øo be that be the definition of a Tyrant, then ≈øee how you come ≈øhort of it in your Actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the highe≈øt Tyrant by that way of Arbitrary Government, and that you have ≈øought to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and that you have ≈øought to put, you were putting upon the People, whether that was not as high an Act of Tyrannie as any of your Predece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øors were guilty of, nay many degrees beyond it.</p>
                  <p>Sir, the term Traytor cannot be ≈øpared, we ≈øhall ea≈øily agree it mu≈øt denote and ≈øuppo≈øe a breach of Tru≈øt, and it mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe it to be done by a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; and therefore Sir, as the People of <hi>England</hi> might have incurred that re≈øpecting you, if they had been truly guilty of it, as to the definition of Law; ≈øo on the other ≈øide, when you did break your Tru≈øt to the Kingdom, you did break your Tru≈øt to your Superior: For the Kingdom is that for which you were tru≈øted: And therefore Sir, for this breach of Tru≈øt, when you are called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, you are called to account by your Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. <hi>Minimus ad Majorem in judicium vocat.</hi> And Sir, the <hi>People of England</hi> cannot be ≈øo far wanting to them≈øelves, which God having dealt ≈øo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øly and gloriou≈øly for, they having power in their hands, and their great Enemy, they mu≈øt proceed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66116:96"/>to do Ju≈øtice to them≈øelves and to you: For, Sir, the Court could heartily de≈øire, That you would lay your hand upon your heart, and con≈øider what you have done ami≈øs: That you would endeavour to make your peace with God. Truly Sir, The≈øe are your high crimes, Tyranny and Trea≈øon.</p>
                  <p>There is a third thing too, if tho≈øe had not been, and that is Murther, which is laid to your charge. All the bloody Murthers that have been committed ≈øince this time that the Divi≈øion was betwixt you and your People, mu≈øt be laid to your charge, that have been acted or committed in the≈øe late Wars. Sir, it is an heinous and crying ≈øin; and truly Sir, if any man will ask us what puni≈øhment is due to a Murtherer, Let Gods Law, let Mans Law ≈øpeak. Sir, I will pre≈øume that you are ≈øo well read in Scripture, as to know what God him≈øelf hath ≈øaid concerning <hi>the ≈øhedding of Mans blood: Gen.</hi> 9. <hi>Num.</hi> 35. will tell you what the puni≈øhment is, and which this Court in behalf of the Kingdom are ≈øen≈øible of, of that innocent blood that has been ≈øhed, whereby indeed the Land ≈øtands ≈øtill defiled with that blood, and as the Text hath it, <hi>It can no way be clean≈øed, but with the ≈øhedding of the blood of him that ≈øhed this blood.</hi> Sir, we know no Di≈øpen≈øation from this blood in that Commandement, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt do no Murder;</hi> we do not know but that it extends to Kings, as well as to the meane≈øt Pea≈øants, the meane≈øt of the People, the command is univer≈øal. Sir, Gods Law forbids it, Mans Law forbids it, nor do we know that there is any manner of exception, nor even in mans Laws, for the puni≈øhment of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in you. 'Tis true, that in the ca≈øe of Kings eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private hand was not to put forth it ≈øelf to this work for their Reformation and puni≈øhment. But Sir, the People repre≈øented having power in their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66116:96"/>hands, had there been but one wilful act of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by you committed, had power to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented you, and to have puni≈øhed you for it.</p>
                  <p>But then Sir, the weight that lies upon you in all tho≈øe re≈øpects that have been ≈øpoken, by rea≈øon of your <hi>Tyranny, Trea≈øon, breach of Tru≈øt,</hi> and the <hi>Murthers</hi> that have been committed, ≈øurely Sir, it mu≈øt drive you into a ≈øad con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration concerning your eternal condition: As I ≈øaid at fir≈øt, I know it cannot be plea≈øing to you to hear any ≈øuch things as the≈øe are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned unto you from this Court, for ≈øo we do call our ≈øelves, and ju≈øtifie our ≈øelves to be a Court, and a <hi>High Court of Ju≈øtice,</hi> authorized by the highe≈øt and ≈øolemne≈øt Court of the Kingdom, as we have often ≈øaid; and although you do yet endeavour what you may to di≈ø-court us, yet we do take knowledge of our ≈øelves to be ≈øuch a Court as can admini≈øter Ju≈øtice to you, and we are bound, Sir, in duty to do it. Sir, all I ≈øhall ≈øay before the reading of your Sentence, it is but this; the Court does heartily de≈øire, that you will ≈øeriou≈øly think of tho≈øe evils that you ≈øtand guilty of. Sir, you ≈øaid well to us the other day, you wi≈øht us to have God before our eyes: Truly Sir, I hope all of us have ≈øo, that God that we know is a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> that God with whom there is no re≈øpect of per≈øons, that God that is the avenger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, we have that God before us, that God that does be≈øtow a Cur≈øe upon them that withhold their hands from ≈øhedding of blood, which is the ca≈øe of guilty Malefactors, and that do de≈øerve death; That God we have before our eyes, and were it not that the con≈øcience of our duty hath called us unto this place, and this
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66116:97"/>imployment, Sir, you ≈øhould have had no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Court here: but Sir, we mu≈øt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the di≈øcharge of our duty unto God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom, before any other re≈øpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever: and although at this time many of us, if not all of us, are ≈øeverely threatned by ≈øome of your party, what they intend to do. Sir, we do here declare, that we ≈øhall not decline, or forbear the doing of our duty in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration of Ju≈øtice even to you, according to the merit of your offence, although God ≈øhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit tho≈øe men to effect all that bloody de≈øign in hand again≈øt us. Sir, we will ≈øay, and we will declare it, as tho≈øe Children in the fiery Furnace, that would not wor≈øhip the golden Image that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had ≈øet up, <hi>That their God was able to deliver them from that danger that they were neer unto;</hi> but yet if he would not do it, yet, notwith≈øtanding that, they would not fall down and wor≈øhip the Image: we ≈øhall thus apply it: That though we ≈øhould not be delivered from tho≈øe bloody hands and hearts that con≈øpire the overthrow of the Kingdom in general, of us in particular, for acting in this great work of Ju≈øtice, though we ≈øhould peri≈øh in the work, yet by Gods grace, and by Gods ≈øtrength, we will go on with it: And this is all our Re≈øolutions. Sir, I ≈øay for your ≈øelf, we do heartily wi≈øh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire, that God would be plea≈øed to give you a ≈øence of your ≈øins, that you would ≈øee wherein you have done ami≈øs, that you may cry unto him, that God would deliver you from blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltine≈øs. A good King was once guilty of that particular thing, and was clear otherwi≈øe, ≈øaving in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>riah.</hi> Truly Sir, the Story tells us, that he was a repentant King, and it ≈øignifies
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66116:97"/>enough that he had dyed for it, but that God was plea≈øed to accept of him, and to give him his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not dye, but the Child ≈øhall dye, thou ha≈øt given cau≈øe to the enemies of God to bla≈øpheme.</hi>

                  <p>You di≈øavow us as a <hi>Court,</hi> and therefore for you to addre≈øs your ≈øelf to us, not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge us as a Court to judge of what You ≈øay, it is not to be permitted; and the <hi>truth</hi> is, all along from the fir≈øt time, You were plea≈øed to di≈øavow and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own us, the Court needed not to have heard You one word; for unle≈øs they be acknowledged a Court, and engaged, it is not proper for you to ≈øpeak: <hi>Sir,</hi> we have given you too much liberty already, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of too much delay, and we may not admit of any further; were it proper for us to do, we ≈øhould hear You freely, and we ≈øhould not have declined to

But Sir, I ≈øhall trouble You no longer, Your ≈øins are ≈øo large a dimen≈øion, that if you do but ≈øeriou≈øly think of them they will drive you to a ≈øad con≈øideration, they may improve in you a ≈øad and ≈øerious repentance. And that the <hi>Court</hi> doth heartily wi≈øh, that You may be ≈øo penitent for what You have done ami≈øs, that God may have mercy at lea≈øtwi≈øe upon your better part. Truly Sir, for the other, it is our parts and duties to do that that the Law pre≈øcribes, we are not here <hi>Jus dare,</hi> but <hi>Jus dicere;</hi> We cannot be unmindful of what the Scriptures tell us, For <hi>to acquit the guilty is of equal abomination as to condemn the innocent;</hi> we may not acquit the guilty; what Sentence the Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms to a Traitor, Tyrant, a Murtherer, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy to the Countrey, that Sentence you are now to hear read unto you, and that is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Pre≈øident</hi> commands the Sentence to be read. Make an O Yes, and command ≈øilence while the Sentence is read.</p>
                  <p>O Yes made, ≈øilence commanded.</p>
                  <p>The Clerk read the Sentence, which was drawn up in parchment.</p>

I ≈øhall begin fir≈øt with my <hi>Innocency;</hi> In troth, I think it not very needful for me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt long upon this, for all the world knows that I never did begin a War with the two hou≈øes of Parliament, and I call God to witne≈øs, to whom I mu≈øt ≈øhortly make an account. That I never did intend for to encroach upon their Priviledges, they began upon me; it is the Militia they began upon, they confe≈øt that the <hi>Militia</hi> was mine, but they thought it fit for to have it from me: and to be ≈øhort, if any body will look to the dates of Commi≈ø≈øions, of their Commi≈ø≈øions and mine, and likewi≈øe to the Declarations, will ≈øee clearly that they began the≈øe unhappy troubles, not I: ≈øo that as to the guilt of the≈øe enormous Crimes that are laid again≈øt me, I hope in God that God will clear me of; I will not, I am in charity: God

But this is not all, my Charity mu≈øt go further, I wi≈øh that they may repent, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have committed a great ≈øin in that particular: I pray God with St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> that this be not laid to their charge, nay not only ≈øo, but that they may take the right way to the peace of the Kingdom; for my Charity commands me, not only to forgive particular men, but my Charity commands me to endeavour to the la≈øt ga≈øp the Peace of the Kingdom. So (Sir) I do wi≈øh with all my Soul (and I do hope there is ≈øome here
<note n="*" place="margin">Turning to ≈øome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that wrote.</note> will carry it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66116:103"/>further) that they may endeavour the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>Now (Sirs) I mu≈øt ≈øhew you both how you are out of the way, and will put you in the way: Fir≈øt, you are out of the way, for certainly all the way you ever have had yet, as I could find by any thing, is in the way of Conque≈øt; certainly this is an ill way: for Conque≈øt (Sir) in my opinion is never ju≈øt, except there be a good ju≈øt Cau≈øe, either for matter of wrong, or ju≈øt Title, and then if you goe beyond it, the fir≈øt quarrel that you have to it, is it that makes it unju≈øt at the end that was ju≈øt at fir≈øt: But if it be only matter of Conque≈øt, then it is a great Robbery, as a Pirate ≈øaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was the great Robber, he was but a petty Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and ≈øo, Sir, I doe think the way that you are in, is much out of the way. Now, Sir, for to put you in one way, believe it, you will never do right, nor God will never pro≈øper you, until you give God his due, the King his due (that is, my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øors) and the People their due: I am as much for them as any of you: You mu≈øt give God his due, by regulating rightly his Church, (according to his Scriptures) which is now out of order: For to ≈øet you in a way particularly, now I cannot, but only this, <hi>A National Synod freely called,</hi> freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating among them≈øelves, mu≈øt ≈øettle this; when that every Opinion is freely and clearly heard.</p>
                           <p>For the King, indeed I will not‚Äî (<hi>Then turning to a Gentleman that touched the Ax, ≈øaid,</hi> Hurt not the Ax, that may hurt
<note n="*" place="margin">Meaning if he did blunt the edge.</note> me.) For the King, the Laws of the Land will clearly in≈øtruct you for that; therefore, becau≈øe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my own particular, I only give you a touch of it.</p>
                           <pb n="200" facs="tcp:66116:104"/>
                           <p>For the people: and truly I de≈øire their Liberty and freedom as much as any body who≈øoever, but I mu≈øt tell you, that their Liberty and freedom con≈øi≈øts in having of Government, tho≈øe Laws by which their Life and their Goods may be mo≈øt their own. It is not for having ≈øhare in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (Sir) that is nothing pertaining to them: A Subject and a Soveraign are clean different things, and therefore until they do that, I mean, That you do put the people in that Liberty, as I ≈øay, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will never enjoy them≈øelves.</p>
                           <p>Sir, It was for this that now I am come here: If I would have given way to an Arbitrarie way, for to have all Laws changed according to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here; and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your charge) that <hi>I am the Martyr of the people.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Introth Sirs, I ≈øhall not hold you much longer, for I will onely ≈øay this to you, that in truth I could have de≈øired ≈øome little time longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe I would have put this that I have ≈øaid in a little more order, and a little better dige≈øted than I have done, and therefore I hope you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe me.</p>
                           <p>I have delivered my Con≈øcience, I pray God that you doe take tho≈øe cour≈øes that are be≈øt for the good of the Kingdom, and your own ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <p>And after a very little pau≈øe, the King ≈øtretching forth his hands, the Executioner at one blow ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his head from his body: The head being off, the Executioner held it up, and ≈øhewed it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which done, it was with the Body put in a Coffin covered with black Velvet for that purpo≈øe, and conveyed into his Lodgings there: And from thence it was carried to his hou≈øe at Saint <hi>James</hi>'s, where his body was embalmed and put in a Coffin of Lead, laid there a fortninght to be ≈øeen by the people; and on the Wedne≈øday ≈øevennight after, his Corps embalmed and coffined in Lead, was delivered chiefly to the care of four of his Servants, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> Captain <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> his Sewers, Captain <hi>Pre≈øton,</hi> and <hi>John Joyner,</hi> former Cook to his Maje≈øty; they attended with others, cloathed in Mourning Suits and Cloaks, accompanied the Her≈øe that night to <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> and placed it in that which was formerly the Kings Bed-chamber; next day it was removed into the <hi>Deans Hall,</hi> which Room was hanged with black, and made dark;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66116:105"/>Lights burning round the Her≈øe, in which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till Three in the Afternoon, about which time came the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the Marque≈øs of <hi>Hertford,</hi> the Marque≈øs of <hi>Dorche≈øter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lynd≈øey,</hi> having obtained an order from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the decent Interment of the King their Royal Ma≈øter, provided the expence thereof exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not five hundred pounds: At their coming into the Ca≈øtle, they ≈øhewed their Order of Parliament to Collonel <hi>Wichcot</hi> Governour of the Ca≈øtle, de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Interment might be in St. <hi>Georges</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and by the Form in the Common-Prayer Book of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> this reque≈øt was by the Governour denyed, ≈øaying, It was improbable that the Parliament would permit the u≈øe of what they had ≈øo ≈øolemnly aboli≈øhed, and therein de≈øtroy their own Act. To which the Lords replyed, There is a difference betwixt de≈øtroying their own Act, and di≈øpen≈øing with it, and that no Power ≈øo binds its own hands, as to di≈øable it ≈øelf in ≈øome ca≈øes: All could not prevail, the Governour per≈øi≈øting in the Negative, the Lords betook them≈øelves to the ≈øearch of a convenient place for the Burial of the Corps; the which after ≈øome pains taking therein, they di≈øcover a Vault in the middle of the Quire, wherein, as is probably conjectured, lyeth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and his beloved Wife the Lady <hi>Jane Seamor,</hi> both in Coffins of Lead; in this Vault, there being Room for one more, they re≈øolve to inter the body of the King, the which was accordingly brought to the place, born by the Officers of the Garri≈øon, the four Corners of the Velvet Pall born up by the afore≈øaid four Lords, the pious Bi≈øhop of <hi>London</hi> following next, and other Per≈øons of Quality; the Body was committed to the earth with ≈øighs and tears, e≈øpecially of the Reverend
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66116:106"/>Bi≈øhop, to be denyed to do the la≈øt Duty and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his Dear and Royal Ma≈øter; the Velvet Pall being ca≈øt into the Vault was laid over the Body, upon the Coffin was the≈øe words ≈øet, <q>KING CHARLES 1648.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the <hi>Regicides</hi> had committed this Horrid and nefarious Act, the prevailing Power con≈øi≈øting of a patcht number of the Hou≈øe of Commons, and the chief Officers of the Army, combined together, and ≈øeeing how ≈øucce≈øsfully and unoppo≈øed they had effected this ≈øo unparalel'd a Deed, to which they knew the generality of the Nation were utterly aver≈øe, and as far as they dur≈øt, ≈øhew'd their ab≈øolute di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; They in the next place fall upon the alteration of the Government, thinking to make ≈øure work by ≈øubverting the Ancient Monarchy of this Realm, and in≈øtead thereof introducing that which they called a <hi>Free State, or Common-wealth.</hi> For con≈øtituting of which the fir≈øt thing they did, was to Vote and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh by Proclamation, <hi>That whereas ≈øeveral pretences might be made to the Crown,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the apparent hazard of the publick Peace, no Per≈øon what≈øoever ≈øhould pre≈øume to proclaim or any way promote</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>Son of the ≈øaid</hi> Charles <hi>late King of</hi> England, <hi>or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to be King or chief Magi≈øtrate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by colour of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, or any other claim what≈øoever, without the free Con≈øent of the People in</hi> Parliament; fir≈øt <hi>≈øignified by a particular Act for that purpo≈øe, any Law or Cu≈øtom to the contrary notwith≈øtanding; and who≈øoever ≈øhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Order proclaim,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>≈øhall be adjudged a Traytor, and ≈øuffer accordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This proceeding was founded upon a Maxim which they had taken up, and agreed on among them≈øelves, namely, <hi>That all Power and Authority is Originally in the People:</hi> But well knowing that their
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66116:106"/>Councils had ≈øoon been confounded, and them≈øelves interrupted in the cour≈øe they had begun, if they had incorporated again with tho≈øe of their Members which had been forcibly kept out by the Army, they Re≈øolve and decree, 1. <hi>That all tho≈øe Members who had a≈ø≈øented to the Vote of</hi> Decemb. 5. <hi>concerning the Kings Conce≈ø≈øions</hi> (for that was the occa≈øion of their ≈øeclu≈øion) <hi>≈øhould never be readmitted, and that tho≈øe that Voted in the Negative, ≈øhould pre≈øently enter their ≈øaid di≈ø≈øent, or before they were to be admitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And together with the fortune of Monarchy was involved that of the <hi>Hou≈øe of Peers,</hi> who having ≈øent to de≈øire a Conference about ≈øetling the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in regard the Judges Commi≈ø≈øions were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Kings Death, in≈øtead of an An≈øwer to their Me≈ø≈øage, the <hi>Junto</hi> of the Commons upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Voted, the Lords Hou≈øe to be <hi>u≈øele≈øs and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> and therefore to be laid a≈øide, as in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they declared the Kingly Office to be <hi>unnece≈ø≈øary</hi> and <hi>Burthen≈øom,</hi> and therefore fit to be aboli≈øhed; only they allowed the Lords the Priviledge of being capable to be cho≈øen Burge≈ø≈øes into the Hou≈øe of Commons; But the Lords were ≈øo highly incen≈øed thereat, that there was ≈øuddenly publi≈øhed a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the name of all the Peers and Barons of the Realm, wherein they prote≈øt again≈øt the Proceedings of the Commons. And a while after ≈øome of the Kings friends in de≈øpite of all Votes, Acts, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the contrary, promoted a Proclamation, in the name of all the Nobility, Gentry, and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Kingdom, for proclaiming <hi>Charles</hi> our pre≈øent Soveraign to be King of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But little could unarmed Declarations prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the reigning Power of an Armed faction, who now a≈ø≈øumed new En≈øigns of Soveraignty, cancelling the Old, and cau≈øed all Writs, Commi≈ø≈øions, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66116:107"/>In≈øtruments of publick Concernment, to be i≈ø≈øued out under a new Stile and Te≈øt, that is of, <hi>The Keepers of the Liberties of</hi> England <hi>by Authority of Parliament.</hi> They ordered the old Great Seal to be broken, and a new one to be made, with the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> on one ≈øide, and this In≈øcription, <hi>The Great Seal of</hi> England; and on the other ≈øide the Hou≈øe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons with this In≈øcription, <hi>In the fir≈øt Year of Freedom by Gods ble≈ø≈øing re≈øtored,</hi> 1648. and appointed the Money to bear the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with this <hi>Motto, God with us;</hi> and the Great Seal was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru≈øted with three Commi≈ø≈øioners: They likewi≈øe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the Kings Arms to be pulled down every where, and the Kings Picture in the <hi>Old Exchange</hi> they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to be defaced, and the following In≈øcription to be be ≈øet behind it in Golden Letters: <q xml:lang="lat">

               </p>
               <p>They next proceed to erect another Illegal High Court of Ju≈øtice, wherein they brought to Tryall D. <hi>Hamilton</hi> taken at the fight at <hi>Pre≈øton,</hi> the E. of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at <hi>King≈øton</hi> Fight, and the L. <hi>Capell</hi> and L. <hi>Goring</hi> taken at the Seige of <hi>Colche≈øter;</hi> The three fir≈øt were Condemned and beheaded at the <hi>Palace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter;</hi> After this the L. <hi>Fairfax</hi> having laid down his Commi≈ø≈øion, the Parliament made <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> their General, who a while after was ≈øent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he proved very ≈øucce≈øsfull.</p>
               <p>His Maje≈øty was now in <hi>France,</hi> and hoped to get aid there, but found none; but the <hi>Junto</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make Sale of the King and Queens Lands, and made a formal Act for aboli≈øhing Kingly Government and di≈øinheriting the Roval I≈ø≈øue, and ≈øeting up a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick or Free State;</hi> This Act Alderman <hi>Reynard≈øon</hi> was commanded to proclaim in the City, which he refu≈øing, was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> with three Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66116:107"/>more; and a new Lord Maior was cho≈øen by a <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> who attended with ≈øeveral other Aldermen as complyant as him≈øelf, readily obeyed the Commands of his Ma≈øters, and proclaimed their Edict in ≈øeveral places of the City.</p>
               <p>A while after, His Maje≈øty was ≈øolemnly Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and after great debate among them there, they at length agree on ≈øome Propo≈øitions to be ≈øent to the King, who was then in the I≈øle of <hi>Jer≈øey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Windram</hi> Laird of <hi>Libberton</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Me≈ø≈øenger; who bringing them to the King, they were ≈øtiffly debated on each ≈øide; but at la≈øt <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> was appointed for the place of a Solemn Treaty, where Commi≈ø≈øioners from the E≈øtates and Kirk met the King, and delivered their Propo≈øitions: During which Treaty, the Marque≈øs of <hi>Montro≈øs</hi> was ≈øeized in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for oppo≈øing the Kirk Party, was condemned and Executed upon a Gibbet near fifty foot high, with all imaginable Contempt; which His Maje≈øty having an Account of, was much troubled, and the Treaty had like to have been broken off, but at length through the nece≈ø≈øity of Affairs was concluded, and being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> after much debate it was re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, another Me≈ø≈øage ≈øhould be ≈øent to invite the King over; but the Parliament here in <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of all the≈øe Proceedings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared an Army thereupon to invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the command of their General <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time General <hi>Blake</hi> their Admiral, took, ≈øunk and burnt mo≈øt of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Fleet, which was a great damage to the Kings Affairs.
