            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THis ſmall Volume is intended for the uſe of thoſe who cannot go to the price of a greater, and yet would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be informed of thoſe wonderful Tranſactions and Revolutions which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in theſe Three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in this laſt Age, and within the memory of many now living: And though it cannot be expected that a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of every particular <hi>Accident</hi> can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this little <hi>Compendium,</hi> yet I have endeavoured, without the leaſt paſſion or partiality, briefly to compriſe the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>Matters.</hi>

            <head>THE WARS IN <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEfore we proceed to give an Account of thoſe Unnatural Wars, Ruins, and Devaſtations, which have happened in theſe Kingdoms in this Laſt Age, it may ſeem neceſſary, by way of Introduction, to give a Relation of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral previous Tranſactions before theſe Woful Calamities befel us.</p>
            <p>Upon the 27th. day of <hi>March,</hi> in the year 1625, King <hi>James</hi> departed this life at <hi>Theobalds</hi> in the Fifty ninth year of his Age, when he had reigned Twenty two years compleat: And in the Afternoon of the ſame day <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> his only Son then living, was proclaimed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66116:4"/>King of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing he did, was performing the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of his Fathers Funeral, in which the King himſelf in Perſon followed as chief Mourner immediately after the Herſe; having his Train of black Velvetborn up by the Twelve Peers of the Realm; at his right hand the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and at his left the Earl of <hi>Pembroke.</hi> He then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his Coronation, and after that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated the Marriage with <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> younger Daughter of the Great <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>France,</hi> whom he had formerly ſeen in his Journey through that Countrey into <hi>Spain;</hi> his firſt Complement to her, when he went to meet her at <hi>Dover,</hi> was, <hi>That he deſired to be no longer Maſter of himſelf, then he was Servant to her,</hi> which indeed he made good: for on the day before his deplorable death, he deſired his Daughter, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to aſſure her Mother, if ever he ſaw her again, <hi>That his Thoughts had never ſtrayed from her, and that his Affections ſhould be the ſame to the laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King then called a Parliament, which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the Eighteenth of <hi>June</hi> follwoing, to whom he repreſented in a ſhort Speech, <q>The ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceſſity of raiſing a Subſidy, ſince it would not agree with his Kingly honour to ſhrink from the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which his Father upon ſolid Conſiderations had by conſent of both Houſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; although prevented by death from putting it in Execution: That Money, the ſinews of War muſt be levied, without which neither Army nor Fleet could move; former Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being already disburſed to a penny: That he ſhould ſeem ridiculous to all <hi>Europe,</hi> if he did not now at length proceed to Action: That it was his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66116:4"/>firſt Enterprize, the ſucceſs whereof would have influence upon his following Reign: That it concerned their own Reputations herein to Aſſiſt him effectually, leaſt the world ſhould judge them to have betray'd their King: That Celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was neceſſary becauſe of Winter then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, a ſeaſon prejudicial to Martial At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: the Peſtilence at that time Reigning in the City, which in all probability might cauſe a ſudden Diſſolution of their Meeting: All which Arguments, if duly conſidered, did evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, That it was moſt Honourable, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune and ſafe, to uſe Expedition in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. As for Religion and Manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was reſolved to tread in his Fathers ſteps, hoping that his former life had miniſtred, no juſt grounds for them to ſuſpect the contrary.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament acknowledged theſe Arguments for a Subſidy to be very rational, but yet would not ſuddenly reſolve upon it, till they had firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their two Petitions, concerning Beaſons of Religion and Complaint of their Sufferings, which points had been offered to his Father King <hi>James,</hi> in the cloſe of his laſt Parliament, and by his death were left hitherto unanſwered.</p>
            <p>In both which they received competent ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and likewiſe an account of the Arrears which were due to the Forces both by Sea and Land, together with an Eſtimate of the future Charge and Expence of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War; upon which the King obtained of the Laity freely and abſolutely, Two Subſidies to be paid by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and four from Papiſts; and three Subſidies, from the Clergy. In this Parliament Dr. <hi>Montague</hi> the Kings Chaplain was queſtioned for certain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in his Anſwer to a Book called the <hi>Romiſh Gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66116:5"/>and his defence thereof; Intituled <hi>Appello ad Caeſarem:</hi> And he being brought before the Bar of the Houſe, the Speaker declared their pleaſure; <hi>That they would refer his Cenſure till the next meeting; and in the mean time he ſhould ſtand committed to the Serjeants Ward, till Two Thouſand Pound Bail could be procured for his appearance next Seſſions:</hi> And though the King took him into Protection, as his Servant, yet his Bail-bond remained uncancelled.</p>
            <p>Divers Laws were Enacted in this Parliament, as one <hi>about Obſervation of the Lord's day;</hi> another <hi>for reſtraint of Tipling in Inns, Alehouſes,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe paſſed likewiſe in the Houſe of Commons, <hi>A Bill for Tunnage and Poundage;</hi> but this miſcarried in the Houſe of Lords, becauſe the Commons had limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to a year, whereas it was formerly granted to the Kings Predeceſſors during their lives; it being intended to reduce the Cuſtoms to the Rate, at which they were ſettled in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the fitting of the Parliament, the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> a Papiſt, and his Wife a Proteſtant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both deſirous of each others Converſion, they put their cauſe upon a diſpute between <hi>James Uſher</hi> L. Archbiſhop of <hi>Amargh,</hi> and one <hi>Rookwood</hi> a Jeſuite, who called himſelf <hi>Beaumont;</hi> this was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Drayton</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> the points diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on were, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Praying to Saints, Images, and the Viſibility of the Church;</hi> wherein the Learned Primate ſo foil'd his Adverſary, that the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> was Convinced and Converted to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and his Lady further confirmed therein.</p>
            <p>On the Eleventh of <hi>July,</hi> 1626, the Parliament by reaſon of the ſickneſs, Adjourned till <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1. and then met again at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the King firſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66116:5"/>by himſelf, and next by his two Secretaries, the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> and Sir <hi>John Cook,</hi> declared to them the neceſſity of ſetting forth a Fleet, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which was the Countrey of the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhyns,</hi> who married the Kings Siſter, and was then unjuſtly detained from him by the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Lord Treaſurer likewiſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſeveral Sums of Money, which King <hi>James</hi> died indebted to the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This occaſioned very warm Debates in the Houſe of Commons, who alledged, <hi>That evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels guided the Kings Deſigns; That the Treaſury was miſimployed, That our neceſſties aroſe through Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: That it would be neceſſary to Petition the King for a stricter hand and better Councel to manage his Affairs: That though a former Parliament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the King in a War, yet if things were managed with Contrary deſigns; and the Treaſure miſimployed, this Parliament was not bound to be carried blindſold in Deſigns, not guided by ſound Council: That it was not uſual to grant Subſidies upon Subſidies in one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and no Grievances redneſſed.</hi> With ſeveral other Paſſages of the like Nature.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe very much reflected upon the miſcarriages of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> who was then a perſon of very conſiderable Truſt: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they promiſed to conſider of the Kings deſires, and preſented him a Petition againſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, giving an Account of their damage, aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain Cauſes of their growth, and offering di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Remedies thereunto; unto which a ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Anſwer (if any thing would have ſatisfied) was returned: And hereupon there followed a Debate about Supplies; ſome were for contributing preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, others demurr'd, as diſliking the deſign in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66116:6"/>hand; and in concluſion the Major part agreed not to give: And being incenſed againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> they began to think of diveſting him of his Offices, and to require an Account of the Publick Moneys wherewith he had been intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all which they intended to include in an humble Remonſtrance: to prevent which, the King reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Diſſolve the Parliament; and accordingly the Uſher of the Black Rod was ſent from the Houſe of Lords to the Commons, who were then reſolved into a Grand Committee; and underſtanding the Kings pleaſure, they cauſed the Speaker to keep his Seat, while they agreed upon a Meſſage of Thanks to his Majeſty for his Gracious Anſwer to their Petition for Religion, and for his care of their Health, in giving them leave to depart this dangerous time of Sickneſs; with a dutiful Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Affection and Loyalty, and of their purpoſing to ſupply him in a Parliamentary way, in fit and convenient time: After which they were accordingly diſſolved.</p>
            <p>Now the War with <hi>Spain</hi> being intended both for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and to prevent diſturbance in our Civil Eſtate, the Councel here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſolve with all ſpeed to ſet forth a Fleet, and to preſerve ſtrict Unity and Peace with <hi>France, Denmark,</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> the King had already entered into a League Offenſive and Defenſive againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and likewiſe had promiſed to aſſiſt them in ſoliciting other Princes to enter into the ſame Confederation, upon Condition that they ſhould bear a Fourth part of the Charge of the Fleet; and in purſuance hereof, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> were ſent to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and there meeting with the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66116:6"/>and <hi>Denmark,</hi> they concluded a League for reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Liberties of <hi>Germany;</hi> the two laſt Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors having no further power from their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteams.</p>
            <p>A while after the Diſſolution of the Parliament, the King publiſhed a Proclamation, Commanding the return of all Children of Noble-men, which had been ſent to be Educated in <hi>Seminaries</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Schools beyond Sea; that none who had received Orders from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould preſume to confer Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or Exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical Functions in any of his Dominions; and likewiſe that the Statute be put in Execution for the departure of Prieſts and Jeſuites, out of his Majeſties Dominions.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of the Diſſolving the Parliament, the <hi>Act of Subſidies</hi> was prevented, and the King was neceſſitated to take up Money upon <hi>Loan</hi> of ſuch Perſons as were of Ability to lend; and to that end he directed his Letters to the Lord Leiutenants of the ſeveral Counties, <hi>To return the Names of thoſe Men whom they thought moſt ſufficient, The places of their Habitations, and what Sums each might be judged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lend;</hi> and to the perſons returned, Letters were Iſſued forth in the Kings Name to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That his Majeſty having obſerved in the Preſidents and Customs of former times. That all the Kings and Queens of this Realm,</hi> upon extraordinary occaſions have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either to reſort to thoſe Contributions which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the generality of Subjects, or to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate helps of ſome well affected in particular, <hi>by way of</hi> Loan; <hi>in the former of which, as his Majeſty has no doubt in the Love and affection of his People, when they ſhall again Aſſemble in Parliament; ſo for the preſent he was inforced to proceed in the latter courſe for ſupply of ſome Portions of Treaſure for divers publick
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66116:7"/>Services, which without manifold Inconveniences to his Majesty, and his Kingdoms cannot be deferr'd: and therefore this being the first time that his Majeſty hath required any thing of this kind, he doubts not but he ſhall receive ſuch a Teſtimony of good affection from them among other of his Subjects, and that with ſuch alacrity and readineſs as may make the ſame ſo much the more acceptable; eſpecially ſince his Majeſty required but the Sum which few men would deny a Friend, and has a mind reſolved to expoſe all his Earthly Fortune for Preſervation of the General: The Sum which</hi> His Majeſty requires by theſe preſents is— <hi>which His Majeſty promiſeth in the Name of himſelf, his Heirs, and Succeſſors, to repay to them or their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, within Eighteen Months after the payment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Collector: The Perſon whom his Majesty hath appointed is — to whoſe</hi> hands his Majeſty doth require them to ſend it <hi>within Twelve days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have received this Privy Seal; which together with the Collectors Acquittance, ſhall be ſufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the Officers of Receipt for their payment thereof at the time limited: And the Collectors of the Loan</hi> were ordered to pay the Sums received into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and to return the Names of ſuch as went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to delay or excuſe the Payment of the Sums required.</p>
            <p>And now about the beginning of <hi>October</hi> the Fleet ſet to Sea, the Lord <hi>Cecill,</hi> ſecond Son to the Earl of <hi>Exeter,</hi> commanding the Land Forces, and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> being Vice Admiral at Sea; but they were ſurprized by ſo violent a Storm, that the greateſt part of the Navy, which in all made up Fourſcore Ships (ſome being <hi>Dutch)</hi> were diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and ſcattered for ſeven days together, and an excellent Ship with an 170 Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in her, were all caſt away, and loſt;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66116:7"/>the Deſign was to have furprized <hi>Cadiz</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> to burn the Ships in the Harbour, and to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plate Fleet, which was daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the <hi>Indies;</hi> but by reaſon of the Plague amongſt them, and ſome other miſcarriages of the Commanders, the buſineſs was wholly diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Fleet returned home but four days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Plate Fleet came.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second of <hi>February</hi> was the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at which the King did not paſs through the City in State from the <hi>Tower,</hi> as was uſual, but went by Water from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for fear of the danger of a Concourſe of People; the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which raged the year before not being quite ceaſed: The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> as Dean of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> ſhould have performed the chief part of the Ceremony, but being under diſpleaſure, Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> then Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> ſupplied his place.</p>
            <p>Divers conſiderable Forces had been raiſed both for Sea and Land, for the better Diſcipline of whom, 150 old Souldiers were ſent for from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by whoſe Induſtry they were brought into ſome good order againſt the meeting of the next Parliament, which was ſummoned to ſit <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. And being met accordingly, the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons choſe Sir <hi>Henage Finch</hi> for their Speaker.</p>
            <p>The firſt buſineſs they inſiſted upon, was the rendring thanks to the King for his gracious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their late Petition concerning Religion, then they debated of the Publick Grievances, <hi>viz.</hi> The miſcarrying of the Fleet at <hi>Cadiz;</hi> the evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors about the King; miſimploying the Kings Revenue; an Account of the Subſidies and three Fifteens, granted in the 21 Year of King <hi>James:</hi> And in the Committee of Grievances, theſe four particulars were inſiſted on: 1. The ſtate of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66116:8"/>King in the conſtant Revenue of the Crown, and how much it had been diminiſhed by Gifts of Lands, Grants of Penſions, Fruitleſs Embaſſies, the Privy Purſe, and other ways. 2. The Condition of the Subject in his Freedom, about laying new impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, multiplying Monopolies, Leuying of Cuſtoms without Act of Parliament, and waſting the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. 3. The Cauſe of the Nations good ſucceſs in former times, whereby it was feared, Victorious and Renowned abroad; which they judged was occaſioned by the Wiſdom and Gravity of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, who ordered nothing but by publick Debate; whereby there aroſe a readineſs in the People to Aſſiſt their Soveraign in Purſe and Perſon. 4. The preſent Condition of the Kingdom, wherein was repreſented the loſs of its wonted Reputation, through the ill ſucceſs at <hi>Algier</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in Count <hi>Manfields</hi> Expedition, and at <hi>Cadiz;</hi> and this was imputed to the want of ſuch Counſels as were formerly uſed; ſince for fear of not ſucceeding, men were now afraid of venturing either there Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Purſes.</p>
            <p>There was likewiſe a Committe concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the growth of Popery, wherein Mr. <hi>Richard Montagues</hi> two Books before mentioned were again queſtioned, and Articles drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, charging him with ſeveral Paſſages for encouraging Popery, and drawing his Majeſties Subjects from the true Religion Eſtabliſhed into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Superſtition, with other paſſages diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the late King, and full of injurious and railing Language againſt other Perſons; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that he endeavoured to raiſe Factions in the Kingdom, by caſting the ſcandalous Name of <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> upon ſuch of his Majeſties Subjects as conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the Doctrine of the Church of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66116:8"/>
               <hi>England:</hi> upon which the Houſe of Commons or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that he ſhould be brought to Exemplary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and to have his Books burnt; nor do we find that he ever made any Defence or Anſwer to thoſe Articles that were brought againſt him: It is affirmed that a while before the ſitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> underſtanding from the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> that the King intended to leave Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> to a Tryal, was heard to utter theſe words, <hi>Iſeem to ſee a Cloud ariſing and threatning the Church of</hi> England, <hi>God in his Mercy diſſipate it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Commons queſtioned ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were of the Council of War, upon the Affairs of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> concerning the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that buſineſs, complaint was likewiſe made in the Houſe of the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nobility, for claiming precedency of the Peers of <hi>England,</hi> of which redreſs was promiſed; but a while after the Lord <hi>Martrevers,</hi> Eldeſt Son and Heir to the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> Married the Daughter of the late Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> contrary to the Kings Mind, who intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her for the Lord <hi>Lorn,</hi> Son and Heir of the Earl of <hi>Argile;</hi> whereupon the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was committed to the <hi>Tower;</hi> which upon the Peers Petitioned to the King, alledging, <hi>That no Peer ſitting in the Parliament, is to be impriſoned without Order from the Houſe of Lords, unleſs for Felony, Treaſon, or denying to give ſecurity for the Peace.</hi> Upon this there aroſe a Diſpute, which laſted for the ſpace of two Months, and then the Earl was ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>In which time the Houſe of Commons were very buſie in ſearching the <hi>Signet Office,</hi> for the Original of a Letter under the <hi>Signet,</hi> written to the Mayor of <hi>York,</hi> for reprieving divers Jeſuites, Prieſts, and other <hi>Popiſh</hi> Recuſants: This was reported by Mr.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66116:9"/>
               <hi>Pim</hi> Chairman to the Committee for Religion; but their proceedings therein were interrupted by a Meffage from the King, ſent by Sr. <hi>Richard Weston,</hi> Chancellor of the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> demanding a ſupply for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Forces.</hi> This was ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſented, that Mr. <hi>Clement Cook,</hi> one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers openly Proteſted, <hi>That it was better to die by a Forreign Enemy, than to be deſtroyed at home:</hi> And Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> another of the Houſe ſeconded him with theſe Queries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether the King had not loſt the Regality of the Narrow Seas ſince the D. of</hi> Buckingham <hi>was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixal?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether his going as Admiral in this laſt Fleet, was not the cauſe of its ill Succeſs, and return without any conſiderable Action?</hi> 3. <hi>Whether the Kings Treaſure hath not been impaired by the Dukes Immenſe Liberality?</hi> 4. <hi>Whether he hath not Ingroſſed all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and prefer'd his Kindred to moſt places?</hi> 5. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath not ſold places of Judicature?</hi> 6. <hi>Whether</hi> Popiſh <hi>Recuſants have not dependance upon his Mother and Father in Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe bold Expreſſions ſo provoked the King, that he immediately ſent Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Satisfaction of the Houſe of Commons, whereupon Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> preſently after made a Speech in Vindication, and for explaining himſelf, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That what he had ſaid was for the good of the Kingdom, and not reflecting upon any one in patticular. That to accuſe upon common Fame, he thought to be a Parliamentary way, and warranted by the Cannons of the Church, the</hi> Imperial <hi>Laws, and by Ancient Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents. The Duke of</hi> Suffolk <hi>in King</hi> Hen. <hi>the Sixths time, having been accuſed upon Common Fame. He added likewiſe, That Mr.</hi> Chancellor <hi>himſelf had preſented ſome perſons upon particular Fame, and that he knew no reaſon why himſelf might not in that place have as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66116:9"/>ample Priviledge;</hi> and the further debate of the matter being referr'd till another time, Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> in the mean ſpace writ a Letter to the Speaker to excuſe his abſence, by reaſon of ſome Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and to ſignify his deſire of putting himſelf wholly upon the Judgment and Cenſure of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> ſpeaking his Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Grievances, ſaid, <hi>That the True Cauſe of them, was, becauſe</hi> (as was ſaid of Lewes <hi>the 11th of</hi> France) <hi>all the Kings Council Rode upon one Horſe,</hi> And that therefore His Majeſty was to be adviſed, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was by <hi>Jethro,</hi> to make choice of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, to aſſiſt him that ſhould be thus qualified: 1. <hi>Noble,</hi> not Upſtarts, and of a Nights Growth. 2. <hi>Men of Courage,</hi> ſuch as would execute their own places, and not commit them to undeſerving Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 3. <hi>Fearing God,</hi> not inclining to falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or halting between two Opinions. 4. <hi>Dealing truly,</hi> not given to Flattery, or favouring Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but ſuch as might be ſafely truſted by the King and Kingdom. 5. <hi>Hating Covetouſneſs,</hi> not ſuch as lived upon other Mens Means, or that would take Bribes, or ſell places in Church or State, or about the King. 6. <hi>To be many, in the multitude of Councellors there being ſafety.</hi> 7. To judg of ſmall matters as well as great (the greateſt being to be referr'd to the King) much leſs any one Councellor alone to manage all buſineſs. 8. <hi>Elders,</hi> not young and unexperienced Men, through whoſe raſh and unadviſed proceedings, great Deſigns many times miſcarry.</p>
            <p>And herein he was ſeconded by Sr. <hi>John Eliot,</hi> who repreſented to the Houſe, The preſent State of the Kingdom, and the great diſhonour the King and Kingdom had ſuſtained by ſeveral miſcarriages,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66116:10"/>and ill management of Matters of the higheſt Truſt; he likewiſe mentioned Two Preſidents, the firſt in the 16 year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. when the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Subſidies demanded till the great Officers were Examined; and <hi>Hugh de Burg</hi> being found guilty of Corruption was diſplaced. Another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was in the 10th year of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. when Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply was required, and the Commons complaining that the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> then over-ruled all, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Anſwer, <hi>That they could not give.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe Diſcourſes, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons taking the Kings Neceſſities into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Voted Three Subſidies, and Three Fifteens, and that the Bill ſhould be brought in, as ſoon as the Grievances which were repreſented, were redreſſed. They likewiſe conſidered of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the miſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the Revenue; and ordered that the Duke ſhould again have notice of their Intentions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: But the King obſerving they did not make ſuch haſt as he expected, to anſwer his laſt Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſummons both Houſes together; and by the Lord Keeper complains to them, <q>For not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Dr. <hi>Turner,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and likewiſe for ſearching his Signet Office, and alſo juſtified the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to have acted nothing of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Imployment without his Special Warrant, and therefore forbid them to concern themſelves any further therein, as looking upon it to be Libelling his own Government; laſtly he blamed them for being too ſparing in the matter of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and for ordering the Bill not to be brought in till their Grievances were heard and anſwered, which he would not admit of.</q> This was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Lord Keepers Speech, to which the King himſelf added.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:66116:10"/>
            <p>
               <hi>He must alſo put them in mind that his Father mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their Counſel and won by their Perſwaſions, broke the Treaties; and that he himſelf was their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument towards his Father, and was glad to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in any thing which might pleaſe the whole Body of the Realm, nor was there any then in greater Favour than the Duke, whom they now traduced; but that now finding him ſo far intangled in a War, that he could make no honourable nor ſafe Retreat, they made neceſſity their Priviledge, and ſet what rate they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon their Supplies,</hi> a Practiſe not very obliging <hi>towards Kings: and whereas Mr.</hi> Cook <hi>told them,</hi> That it was better for them to die by a Forreign Enemy, than to be deſtroyed at home: <hi>Indeed he thought it to be more Honourable for a King to be Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and almost deſtroyed by a Forreign Enemy, than to be deſpiſed at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, at a Conference of both Houſes in the Painted Chamber, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was commanded by the King, to explain ſome Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Kings and the Lord Chancellors Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which might be ſubject to miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which the Duke performed accordingly, and then gave a large Account of his Negotiation in the <hi>Low Countreys;</hi> as ſoon as the Duke had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> diſcourſed of the Treaties of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the buſineſs of the Navy, and affirmed they were not done by ſingle Councel, ſince King <hi>James</hi> himſelf commanded it.</p>
            <p>The Commons in Anſwer to the Kings laſt Speech, preſented him with a Remonſtrance to this purpoſe; <hi>That they gratefully acknowledged His Majeſties Expreſſions of Affection to his People and Parliament, That they had taken Mr.</hi> Cooks <hi>and Dr.</hi> Turners <hi>words into Conſideration, and might
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66116:11"/>have given a good Account thereof by this time, if his Majeſties Meſſage had not interrupted them; That they had the Preſidents of former Parliaments for ſearching the Letters of his Majesty and his Secretary of State, the Signet Office, and other Records, upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. That it was the unqueſtionable Priviledge of Parliaments to complain of any Perſon of any degree, and their proceedings in relation to the Duke ſhould not prejudice either Crown or Kingdom: That they were willing to Supply his Neceſſities Liberally and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, if Additions might be made of other things which concerned his Service, and were now in Conſultation among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty having received it, returned this ſhort Anſwer thereunto, <hi>That he would have them in the firſt place, Conſult about Matters of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and that they ſhould have time enough for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things afterward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This happened in the year 1626, and in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Year of his Majeſties Reign; about which time the Earl of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> (being ordered by the King to be Examined by a Committee of Lords, concerning his Negotiation in <hi>Spain,</hi> and having been in Priſon and prohibited acceſs to His Majeſty ever ſince his return) received a Letter from the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> wherein, in order to his Relief he propounded to him from His Majeſty this Choice, <hi>Whether he would be quiet, and not be queſtioned for what was paſt, and enjoy the benefit of the late Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pardon? or whether he would ſtand upon his Juſtification?</hi> To which he Anſwered, <hi>That he did humbly acknowledge and accept of his Majesties Grace and Favour;</hi> And at the ſame time he Petitioned the Houſe of Lords for his Liberty, or to come to a Tryal; who apylying themſelves to his Majeſty, he granted a Writ for the Earls coming to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66116:11"/>but with a Proviſo, That his Perſonal At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance ſhould be forborn; whereupon the Earl ſent another Petition to the Lords that he might be heard, both as to his Reſtraint, and of what he had to ſay againſt the Duke. At which the King was much concerned, and ſignified to the Lords, <hi>That it was his Royal Pleaſure, that the Earl of</hi> Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol <hi>might be ſent for as a Delinquent to anſwer his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences to the Houſe, and his ſcandalizing the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>and his Majesty likewiſe by Reflection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this the Earl was accordingly brought to the Bar, and being ready to be impeacht of High Treaſon by the Attorney General, he beſought their Lordſhips, <hi>That as he was a Freeman and Peer of this Realm untainted, and had ſomething to ſay of high Conſequence for his Majeſties Service, he might have liberty to ſpeak.</hi> Which being granted him, he ſaid, <hi>I accuſe that Man the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>of High Treaſon.</hi> This unexpected procedure of the Earl, occaſioned the Attorney General to draw up a Charge againſt him, conſiſting of Eleven Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles containing Matters of divers Natures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Earl afterwards gave a large Account of the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> proceedings towards him, and then preferr'd Twelve Articles againſt him; and beſides theſe Articles againſt the Duke, the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> exhibited Eleven others againſt the Lord <hi>Conway:</hi> the Earl likewiſe gave in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to each particular Article of his Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now whilſt theſe two Peers were thus conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Houſe of Commons preſented an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to the Lords againſt the Duke, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Twelve Articles, to each of which the Duke made Replies, and the laſt of them being a matter of general Diſcourſe, it may ſeem neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66116:12"/>it, with the Dukes Anſwer thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Duke being a Sworn Servant of the the late King, did cauſe and provide certain Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Potions for his late Majeſty K. <hi>James</hi> in in his laſt Sickneſs without the Privity of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Phyſicians, and that although thoſe Plaiſters and Potions formerly applied, produced ſuch ill Effects, as many of his Sworn Phiſicians did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow, as prejudicial to his Maieſties Health, yet the Duke did apply them again to his Majeſty; whereupon great Diſtempers, and dangerous Symptoms appeared in him, which the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans imputed to thoſe Adminiſtrations of the Duke, whereof his late Majeſty alſo complained: which is an Offence and Miſdemeanor of ſo high a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as may be called an Act of Tranſcendent Preſumption: And the ſaid Commons by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, ſaving to themſelves the liberties of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting hereafter any other Accuſation, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment againſt the Duke, and alſo of Replying unto what the Duke ſhall Anſwer unto the ſaid Articles, do pray, That the ſaid Duke may be put to Anſwer all and every the Premiſes, and that ſuch Proceeding, Examinations, Tryals and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be upon every of them had as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Law and Juſtice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this Article the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That his late Majeſty being ſick of an Ague, a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe out of which the Duke recovered not long before, asked the Duke what he found moſt Advantagious to his Health? The Duke replyed, a Plaiſter, and Poſſit Drink administred unto him by the Earl of</hi> Warwick<hi>'s Phyſician, whereupon the King much deſired the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Poſſit drink to be ſent for, and the Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying it, the King commanded a Servant of the Dukes to go for it, againſt the Dukes earnest requeſt; he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

            <p>About this time the King again earneſtly preſſed the Houſe of Commons for a ſpeedy Supply, by their Speaker Sir <hi>Heneage Finch;</hi> giving them to underſtand, <hi>That if there did not paſs the Bill of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy by the end of the week following, it would inforce him to take other Reſolutions; and if by their denial, or delay, any thing of ill conſequence ſhould fall out ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at home, or abroad, he called God and Man to witneſs, that he had done his part to prevent it, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his People together to adviſe with him; whoſe ſitting (if they diſpatched this according to his deſire) he reſolved to continue, for the diſpatch of other Affairs, and after their Receſs to bring them again together the next Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the Commons ſent an Anſwer, they drew up a Petition to his Majeſty. <q>That he would be pleaſed to Remove from all places of Truſt and Authority, all ſuch Perſons as were either Popiſh Recuſants, or according to the Direction of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Acts of State, juſtly to be ſuſpected to be ſuch.</q> And herewith they likewiſe ſent a large Scrowl of the Names of all ſuch Noblemen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66116:14"/>as continued in places of high Truſt in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Anſwer to the late Articles againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> being by him delivered into the Lords Houſe, he deſired their Lordſhips to ſend to the Commons for a ſpeedy Reply; whereupon the Commons required a Copy of his Anſwer. But the Duke fearing what might be the Effect thereof humbly applyed himſelf to the Lords, whom he intreated to allow him the benefit of a free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon granted by King <hi>James</hi> in Parliament in the 21ſt. Year of his Reign, and likewiſe that of the Coronation.</p>
            <p>Preſently after the Commons drew up another Declaration of Grievances againſt the Duke, whom they reſolved utterly to overthrow, though contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Inclination of the King; who being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at incenſed, diſſolved the Parliament the very next day, <hi>June</hi> 15. 1626. and committed the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to the Tower, Publiſhing a Proclamation for burning all Copies of the ſaid Declaration. After which the King Publiſhed a Declaration, ſhewing the Grounds and Reaſons of his Diſſolving this and the former Parliament.</p>
            <p>Then ſeveral ways were Reſolved on for advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Revenue, and ſpecial care was taken by the Councel for the levying of Cuſtoms and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts upon all Merchandizes Imported and Export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being intended to have been ſettled by the Two laſt Parliaments, but prevented by their ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Diſſolution: The Forfeitures of Papiſts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which had been miſimployed, were now taken into a more ſtrict Account; <hi>Privy Seals</hi> alſo were iſſued out, and <hi>Benevolence</hi> propoſed, and at length a Commiſſion for a General <hi>Loan</hi> was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, as the moſt convenient Method, ſince the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66116:14"/>preſent ſtate of Affairs admitted not of the way of a Parliament, and private Inſtructions were given to the Commiſſioners how to manage the buſineſs, which upon their Faith and Allegiance they were commanded to keep Secret, and not to diſcloſe to any.</p>
            <p>About this time ſome Souldiers returned from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and were Quattered in the Countreys, and Money was raiſed for them, which made this Loan the more unwelcome; and Sir <hi>Randolph Crew</hi> for not appearing vigorous in promoting the Loan, was diſplaced from being L. Chief Juſtice, and Sir <hi>Nich. Hyde</hi> advanced in his place; the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was likewiſe informed againſt in the <hi>Star Chamber</hi> by Sir <hi>John Lamb,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sybthorp,</hi> for ſpeaking againſt the Loan, and ſeeming to favour the Puritans and Nonconformiſts: Not long before which Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> (hearing that the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> endeavoured to ingratiate himſelf with the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi>) Dreamed, <hi>That the Biſhop came to him with Iron Chains, but returned free from them, that he leaped upon a Horſe, departed and he could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake him;</hi> which was afterwards interpreted concerning the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolns</hi> taking Arms for the Parliament in <hi>Wales,</hi> and his being at liberty, when Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was impriſoned in the Tower.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral Occaſions at this time which required conſiderable Supplies of Money, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> there was great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a War with <hi>France</hi> upon this Occaſion; the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13. had borrowed of his Brother in Law, the King of <hi>England,</hi> a Man of War called the <hi>Vauntguard,</hi> and ſix other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships in purſuance of a Deſign againſt <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but with this expreſs Condition that they ſhould not be imployed againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at <hi>Rochel;</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:66116:15"/>there having been an Agreement lately made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and their King by the Mediation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadors: But <hi>Mounſieur Soulize,</hi> who was for the Proteſtants, taking the Advantage of the <hi>French</hi> Armies going into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſuddenly broke that Agreement; for getting ſome ſmall Ships to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he Surprized the Iſle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> and ſome Ships in the Harbour, at which the <hi>French</hi> King being offended, turns his whole Deſign from <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Rochel;</hi> and with the Seven <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships under Admiral <hi>Pennington,</hi> Twenty <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, and the <hi>French</hi> Navy, he furiouſly falls upon <hi>Soulize,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him from his Faſtneſs, and chaſeth him to the Iſle of <hi>Oleron:</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> was much concerned at this Action of the <hi>French</hi> King, as a breach of his Royal Word, and demanded Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; which the <hi>French</hi> King deferring to give, the King Seized a Rich <hi>French</hi> Ship, and the <hi>French</hi> King Arreſted the Goods of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants in <hi>France,</hi> to the value of Three Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds; but at length all was Reconciled and Reſtored on both ſides.</p>
            <p>Thus all ſeemed quiet at preſent, till the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deportment of the Queens Prieſts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor made another Rupture; who Impoſed upon her to go bare-foot, to Spin, to wait upon her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at their Dinners, nay to walk on Foot on a Rainy Morning, from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> to St. <hi>Jameſes,</hi> and from thence as far as <hi>Tybourn</hi> Gallows, to offer up her Prayers for the Souls of ſome <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> whom they ſtiled Martyrs who were formerly Executed there; her Confeſſor himſelf Riding by her in a Coach. Theſe and ſeveral other Arrogancies, being juſtly charged upon the Queens <hi>French</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Servants, they were paid off, diſcharged, and ſent home: Upon which the <hi>French</hi> Arreſted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66116:15"/>the Ships of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wine Merchants at <hi>Blay Caſtle,</hi> which was ſo ill Reſented by his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> that he reſolved upon a Breach with <hi>France:</hi> But about the ſame time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet under the L. <hi>Willoughby,</hi> which were ſent to the Aid of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> were ſo ſcattered by a Storm, that they could ſcarce get into ſafe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>The Aſſeſſment of the <hi>Loan</hi> was generally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whereupon the People of the lower Rank were ordered to appear in the <hi>Military Yard</hi> near St. <hi>Martins in the Fields,</hi> before the Lieutenant of the Tower, to be Liſted for Souldiers; it being thought fit, that thoſe who refuſed to aſſiſt with their Purſes in Common Defence, ſhould be forced to ſerve in their Perſons; others of better Quality, were bound to appear at the Council Table; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of whom were committed Priſoners to the <hi>Fleet, Marſhalſea, Gatehouſe,</hi> and other Priſons, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them Sir <hi>John Eliot,</hi> who Petitioned his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and repeated many Preſidents, <hi>That all manner of Aids and Taxes informer Kings Reigns were never levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by the general Conſent of the Nobility and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Aſſembled in Parliament.</hi> However he was committed Priſoner to the <hi>Gatehouſe,</hi> and upon the ſame Account Sir <hi>Peter Hayman</hi> was commanded to Serve his Majeſty in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which after he had ſettled his Eſtate he did acordingly.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Sybthorp</hi> and Dr. <hi>Maynwaring,</hi> two Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Preachers at Court, about this time preached up the Neceſſity and Duty of the Loan; one of them Aſſerting, <hi>That the Prince hath Power to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Councel, and make Laws, and that Subjects, if they cannot Exhibit Active Obedience, in Caſe the thing commanded ſhould be againſt the Law of God, or Nature, or more Impoſſible, yet nevertheleſs they ought
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66116:16"/>to yield Paſſive Obedience; and in all other Caſes they were bound to Active Obedience.</hi> The other Affirmed, <hi>That the Kings Royal Command in Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Loans and Taxes, though without common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Parliament, did Oblige the Subjects Conſcience upon Pain of Eternal Damnation.</hi> Which Poſitions being entertained by the Court with Applauſe, the Sermon of Dr. <hi>Sybthorp,</hi> call'd <hi>Apoſtolick Obedience,</hi> was Licenſed and Approved of by Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> B. of <hi>London;</hi> and an expreſs Command was ſent from the King to Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> to Licenſe it, which he refuſed, whereupon having been under ſome disfavour before, this Increaſed it, and he was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from his Archiepiſcopal See, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was granted to Five Biſhops to Execute his Office: After which the Biſhop Publiſhed a Narrative of the Cauſe and Manner of his Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Five of thoſe Gentlemen who were Impriſoned about the Loan; had their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> granted, and were brought to their Tryal before Sir <hi>Nicholas Hyde</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice; where, after arguing the Caſe between Council on both ſides, the L. Chief Juſtice concluded, <hi>That ſince they were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Kings Authority,</hi> the Court could not Free them, ſo that they were remanded to Priſon, till the Order came out for a General Releaſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh Papists,</hi> in hope of ſome Remiſſion of the Penal Laws, offered to Furniſh the King at their own Charge with a ſtanding Army of 5000 Foot and 500 Horſe, and a large Contribution for ſecuring the Narrow Seas, which was oppoſed in <hi>England</hi> by Sir <hi>John Savil,</hi> and in <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Lord Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> and divers others, as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to preſerve the <hi>Papists</hi> Intereſts, and ſinking the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> upon which the L.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66116:16"/>the <hi>Primate</hi> to endeavour to prevail with the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to ſupply the Kings Neceſſities; which he attempted to do in a very learned Speech, though not with the expected Succeſs.</p>
            <p>In 1627, being the Third Year of his Majeſties Reign, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to clear his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as to the Charge of Negligence in his Admiralſhip, with much ado compleated his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Forces, conſiſting of Six Thouſand Horſe and Foot in Ten Ships Royal, and Ninety Merchant Men; with which he ſet Sail from <hi>Portſmouth June</hi> 27, and publiſhed a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of the Kings Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches in <hi>France,</hi> and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt the laſt miſimploying of his Ships againſt the <hi>Rochellers.</hi> But by ſeveral Accidents this great Deſign miſcarried, with the Death of near Two Thouſand common Souldiers, Thirty Priſoners of Note and Fourty four Colours taken: But notwithſtanding this Expedition of the Iſle of <hi>Rhe</hi> miſcarried, yet at Sea there was ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Succeſs; a great <hi>French</hi> Ship was taken upon the Coaſts of <hi>Holland,</hi> Laden with great Guns, Arms, and Ammunition of all ſorts, to a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable value; Sir <hi>John Pennington</hi> likewiſe took Thirty Four Rich <hi>French</hi> Merchantmen, home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bound, which were all ſafely brought to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the poor remains of the Army which came from the Iſle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> moſt of them <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and conſequently rude and boiſterous, were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Countrey Villages, which was very troubleſome to the People.</p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>Exchequer</hi> was very low, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral late Enterprizes having miſcarried, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers</hi> being alſo now more diſtreſſed than ever; the cauſes of theſe evils were gravely repreſented by Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> to ſeveral Lords of the Councill;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66116:17"/>whereupon it was reſolved on by the Council, that a Parliament ſhould be called, and Writs were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Iſſued out; A Commiſſion likewiſe paſſed under the Great Seal, for raiſing Moneys through the Kingdome in Nature of an Exciſe; and the Lord Treaſurer was ordered to pay Thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound to <hi>Philip Burmelack,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant, to be returned to Sir <hi>William Balfour</hi> and <hi>John Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bier</hi> in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> for raiſing a Thouſand Horſe; which cauſed ſtrange jealouſies and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among the People, as if theſe <hi>German</hi> Horſe were deſigned to inforce the payment of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. There was ſome diſcourſe about Levying <hi>Ship money,</hi> but it was declined at that time, becauſe of the Parliament approaching.</p>
            <p>In the mean time a company of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in an Houſe at <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> which was deſigned for a <hi>Colledge</hi> of that Order; where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Papers, a Letter was found, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſecret Deſigns they had laid for imbroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Church and State.</p>
            <p>Upon the 17th of <hi>March</hi> 1627, the Parliament Aſſembled, the Commons chuſing Sin <hi>John Finch</hi> Speaker, the King in a Speech tells the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>That the greatneſs of the danger was ſuch, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a ſpeedy Supply, and that therefore they might reſt aſſured it was the principal cauſe of their Meeting; wherein he hoped they would ſhew themſelves ſuch true Patriots of the true Religion, the Laws and Liberties of this State, and the juſt defence of their Friends and Allies, now in ſuch hazard by</hi> Popiſh <hi>Enemies, as not to deceive his Expectations, which were very great, though indeed ſomewhat nipt, by Remembrance of the Diſtractions of the laſt Meeting.</hi> The <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> likewiſe Inforc'd the Kings Speech, and earneſtly preſſed them, to conſider of ſome ſpeedy way for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66116:17"/>Supplying his Majeſties Neceſſities.</p>
            <p>Before the Parliament began any debate, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to them Directed, <hi>To the Members of the Houſe of Commons,</hi> called <hi>A Speech without Doors;</hi> diſcovering the Grievances and Inconveniences of the State, from one who had been a Member of the former Parliament. The firſt thing taken into Conſideration by the Commons, was the Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdom, and the firſt thing Inſiſted on was the Caſe of thoſe Gentlemen for refuſing the <hi>Loan,</hi> and who notwithſtanding their <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> were Remanded to Priſon; and after a long Debate between ſeveral Members, who aſſerted the Illegality of the Loan, and alſo their Impriſonment for refuſing it; the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hyde</hi> and ſeveral other Judges were deſired to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; who juſtified their own proceedings, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That if they had granted them Bail upon</hi> Habeas Corpus, <hi>it would have reflected upon the King, as if he had unjuſtly Impriſoned them:</hi> But in concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was reſolved upon the Queſtion in the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Nemine Contradicente:</hi> 1. <hi>That no man ought to be restrained by the Command of the King or Privy Council, without ſome Cauſe of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Writ of</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>ought to be granted upon Requeſt to every Man that is reſtrained, though by the Command of the King, the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or any other.</hi> 3. <hi>That if a Freeman be impriſoned by the Command of the King, the Privy Council, or any other, and no Cauſe of ſuch Commitment expreſſed, and the ſame be returned upon an</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>granted for the ſaid Party, then he ought to be delivered or Bailed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Parliament proceeded to draw up a Petition againſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> Recuſants, conſiſting of theſe particulars. 1. <hi>That all Laws and Statutes againſt Jeſuites and Popiſh Prieſts, be put in power and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi> 2. <hi>That a ſtrict courſe be taken for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66116:18"/>and Diſcovering of them.</hi> 3. <hi>That all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Recuſants be prohibited from coming to Court, or within Ten Miles of</hi> London. 4. <hi>That no place of Trust or Authority ſhall be committed to Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants;</hi> with ſeveral other particulars to the ſame purpoſe; which Petition was preſented from the Lords and Commons to the King by the Lord Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who gave a full and ſatisfactory Anſwer to every Article; after which Five Subſidies were granted to the King, which gave ſo great ſatisfaction to his Majeſty, that he ſent them Word; <hi>He would deny them nothing of their Liberties which any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had granted:</hi> A Petition was then preſented againſt Quartering Souldiers in the Countries, to which the King promiſed an Anſwer in convenient time; whereupon the Commons fell upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and after ſeveral of the Members had delivered their Opinions at large concerning ſome Clauſes in it, the Lords agreed that without any Addition or Preface it ſhould be preſented to the King; the Subſtance whereof was.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They do pray his moſt Excellent Majeſty, <hi>That no man hereafter be compelled to make or yield any Gift, Loan, Benevolence, Tax, or ſuch like Charge, without common conſent by Act of Parliament, and that none be called to make Anſwer, or to take? ſuch Oath, or to give Attendance, or be confined, or otherwiſe be moleſted or diſquieted concerning the ſame, or for Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal thereof.</hi> 2. <hi>That no Freeman be taken and impriſoned or be diſſeiſed of his Freehold of Liberty, or his free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, but by the lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Laws of the Land.</hi> 2. <hi>That your Majesty would be pleaſed to remove the Souldiers and Marriners now Billeted in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and that your People may not be ſo burdened for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66116:18"/>the time to come.</hi> 4. <hi>That the late Commiſſions for proceeding by Martial Law, may be revoked and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, and that hereafter no Commiſſion of like Nature may Iſſue forth to any Perſon or Perſons whatſoever, to be Executed, leaſt by colour of them, any of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Subjects be deſtroyed, or put to death contrary to Law and the Franchiſes of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which we most humbly pray your moſt Excellent Majeſty as their Rights and Liberties according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm; And that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would alſo vouchſafe to declare, That all Awards, Doings, or proceedings, to the prejudice of your People, ſhall not be drawn hereafter into conſequence and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this there came a Letter from the King to the Houſe of Lords, wherein among other things, His Majeſty declared it to be his Royal pleaſure, which God willing he would ever continue and conſtantly maintain; <hi>That neither he, nor his Privy Council, ſhould or would hereafter, command to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or otherwiſe restrain the Perſons of any for not lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money: nor for any Cauſe which in his Conſcience did not concern the publick good; nor would he be drawn to pretend any cauſe, wherein his judgment was not fully ſatisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> Sir Thomas Wentworth (afterwards Earl of Strafford) ſaid, <hi>Was a Letter of Grace, but that the People were not ſo ſatisfied but by a Parliamentary way, That the debate would ſpend much time, That it was not directed to the Houſe of Commons, and that the Petition it ſelf would rectify all miſtakes.</hi> When the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> was preſented to the King, the Anſwer following was quickly returned; <hi>The King willeth that Right be done according to the Laws and Customs of the Realm; and that the Statutes be put in due Execution, that his Subjects may have no cauſe to complain of any wrong or Oppreſſions, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66116:19"/>to their just Rights and Liberties; to the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Whereof he holds himſelf in Conſcience as well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, as to that of his Prerogative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Anſwer being Read in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was not judged Satisfactory; and therefore upon their Humble Petition for a clear and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Anſwer to the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> His Majeſty to ſhew how free and candid his Conceſſions were to his Subjects, ſent them this ſhort but full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; <hi>Soit Droit Lait come il eſt deſire,</hi> Let it be done according to your deſire. Which Anſwer was Received with the general joy and Satisfaction of both Houſes; and the Citizens made Bonefires, and Rung Bells, and his Majeſty for further Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was pleaſed to receive into Favour <hi>Abbot,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Williams,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others: His Majeſty likewiſe ſuffered the Commiſſion of Loan and Exciſe to be cancelled in his preſence, ſo that all diſcontents of every ſide ſeemed to be baniſhed.</p>
            <p>In 1628 the Fourth year of his Majeſties Reign, the Parliament not being ſatisfied of their former diſappointment about the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> drew up another Remonſtrance againſt him, and likewiſe againſt Biſhop <hi>Neal,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> which they preſented to the King with the Bill of Subſidies: His Majeſty telling them, <hi>That he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ſuch a Return for his favourable Anſwer to the</hi> petition of Right, <hi>and as for the Grievances he would take time to conſider of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Information being likewiſe Exhibited againſt the Duke in the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> for divers Offences and Miſdemeanors, an Order was made in that Court, that all proceedings thereupon ſhould be taken off the File, by the Kings expreſs Will and Pleaſure: And becauſe it had been reported by a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66116:19"/>Member of Parliament that the Duke ſhould ſay at his Table, <hi>Piſh, it matters not what the Parliament doth, for without my leave and Authority, they ſhall not be able to touch the Hair of a Dog:</hi> The Duke made Proteſtation in the Houſe of Lords, <hi>That be never had thoſe words ſo much as in his Thoughts.</hi> But the King being reſolved to hold up the Duke, ſent ſo brisk an Anſwer to their Remonſtrances, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Commons (who had ſoon forgot his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties late Act of Grace) to queſtion his taking Tunnage and Poundage; which being of too valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſideration to be hazarded, his Majeſty obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by Adjourning the Parliament to the 20th. of <hi>October,</hi> there being ſeveral Acts paſſed by them, One <hi>About the Lords day,</hi> Another <hi>To reſtrain the ſending any to be</hi> Popiſhly <hi>bread beyond the Seas,</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>for Confirmation of the Subſidies granted by the Clergie, and for the grant of Five Entire Subſidies upon the Temporality,</hi> and divers more.</p>
            <p>Much about this time Dr. <hi>Lamb, who was</hi> in great Favour with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (and had been formerly twice Arraigned, once for <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancy,</hi> and another time for a <hi>Rape</hi>) was killed by the furious Multitude in <hi>Lothbury,</hi> who hated him both for his own ſake and the Dukes, he being called the Dukes Devil; and though he were guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four Conſtables and their Attendants, yet the Rabble ſtruk him down, beat out one of his eyes, and left him half dead on the Ground, from whence he was called to the <hi>Poultrey Counter,</hi> where he died, according to his own Prediction the year before; being pitied by few, and loved of none.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Denbigh</hi> having a while ſince ſailed with Fifty Ships to the relief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> was repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with much loſs; ſo that deſpairing of Succeſs, he returned back to <hi>Plymouth;</hi> whereupon another
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66116:20"/>Expedition was reſolved on, with a more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Navy, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Admiral, who going to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> in order to haſtning of buſineſs, one <hi>John Felton</hi> a Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtabbed him to the heart with a Knife; which the Murtherer flying, left ſticking in his Body, till the Duke himſelf dragg'd it out, and immediately after died: <hi>Felton</hi> was ſoon apprehended by the Servants, and laden with Irons, and being asked, what inclined him to commit ſo horrid an Action? He boldly anſwered, <hi>He killed him for the cauſe of God and his Countrey:</hi> He likewiſe faſtned a Paper in the Crown of his Hart, which intimated, <hi>That his only Motive to this Fact, was the late Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the Commons againſt the Duke, and that he could not ſacrifice his Life in a nobler Cauſe, than by delivering his Countrey from ſo great an Enemy. Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was afterwards Condemned and Hanged at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn,</hi> and his Body hanged upon a Gibbet at <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was obſervation made of divers Paſſages preſaging the Dukes Death, as that his Picture fell down in the high Commiſſion Chamber at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> That the Lady <hi>Davis</hi> reputed a Propheteſs, had foretold in <hi>June,</hi> that the Dukes fatal time would not come till <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and laſtly, that Mr. <hi>Towerſon</hi> of the <hi>Cuſtomhouſe</hi> was charged by a Phantaſm or Ghoſt, reſembling the Dukes Father, to tell him, <hi>That if he changed not his courſes, he ſhould ſhortly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a great Fairing to the City of</hi> London; which was afterwards judg'd to be accompliſhed by his death, which happened the day before the Fair, that is <hi>Auguſt</hi> 23. 1628.</p>
            <p>However the Fleet ſet Sail under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and came to the Bar of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> Haven, where there was a wonderful <hi>Barracado</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:66116:20"/>contrived by Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> of Fourteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Yards, croſs the Channel; however the Earl adventured in, paſſing the Forts and Outworks, but the Wind changing, drove the Ships upon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which unhappy Accident made the <hi>Rochellers</hi> deſpair of Relief, and occaſioned the preſent ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the Town; after which the Earl of <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> brought the Fleet ſafe home again.</p>
            <p>The Parliament was to have met in <hi>October,</hi> but by reaſon of ſome ill news during this Expedition, they were again Adjourned to <hi>January</hi> 20th; in which time the Merchants refuſing to pay Cuſtom, had their goods ſeized; Complaint whereof being made to the Parliament, the King ſummons the two Houſes to the Banquetting Houſe at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and requires them to paſs the promiſed Bill of <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> for ending all differences, ſince it was too precious a Jewel of the Crown to be ſo lightly forgone.</p>
            <p>But the Commons being forward enough to take all occaſions to put of the Kings Requeſts, Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That Gods Cauſe was to be preferr'd before the Kings, and they would therefore in the firſt place conſult con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion;</hi> and thereupon appointed one Committee for <hi>Religion,</hi> and another for <hi>Civil Matters;</hi> in the laſt wherof there was a complaint that the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> had been Printed with the Kings firſt Anſwer only, and not with the laſt which was judged Satisfactory: Another complaint was likewiſe made about the Cuſtoms, and Mr. <hi>Rolls</hi> a Member of the Houſe affirmed, That it was reported ſome of the Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe ſhould ſay, <hi>Though all the Parliament were in you, we would take your Goods;</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Chambers</hi> was likewiſe impriſoned for ſaying at the Council Table, <hi>That ſuch great Customs and Impoſitions were required

The Commons inraged hereat, blamed their Speaker for admitting the Meſſage, and ordered Sir <hi>John Eliot</hi> to read their Remonſtrance (the Speaker and Clerk refuſing to do it) which was to this purpoſe;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Houſe had conſidered of the</hi> Bill <hi>for</hi> Tunnage <hi>and</hi> Poundage, <hi>but being overprest with other buſineſs, and that of it ſelf ſo perplext, as would require much leiſure to diſcharge, could not at that time finiſh it; this preſent Seſſion moving haſtily to an end; and leaſt his Majesty ſhould hereafter, as he had done heretofore,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66116:21"/>encline to Evil Spirits, or to be abuſed to believe, that might justly receive the Subſidies of</hi> Tonnage <hi>and</hi> Poundage, <hi>which they humbly declare to be againſt the Fundamental Law of the Nation, and contrary to the Kings late Anſwer to the</hi> Petition of Right) <hi>therefore they crave that his Majesty would for the future forbear ſuch Taxes, and not take it ill, if his Subjects refuſe what is demanded by Arbitrary and unwarrantable Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Report was likewiſe made from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Pardons by <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> (a fatal name afterward) that Dr. <hi>Neal</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was cheifly Inſtrumental, in procuring the Kings hand to the Pardons of Dr. <hi>Sybthorp,</hi> Dr. <hi>Maynwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Mr. <hi>Couſens,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> and that he had likewiſe preferr'd Dr. <hi>Maynwaring</hi> to a rich Living, though cenſured by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Parliament, and diſabled from holding any Eccleſiaſtical Dignity; and alſo that he was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancer not only of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> but flat <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commons having prepared their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance about the Bill of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> they required their Speaker to put it to the Vote, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhould be preſented to the King, or not; but the Speaker refuſed it, and accordingly to the Kings order would have gone away; but Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> would not ſuffer him to ſtir till himſelf had read the Proteſtation of the Houſe, conſiſting of 3 Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whoever ſhall bring in any Innovation of Religion, or by favour ſeek to introduce Popery, or Arminianiſm, or other Opinions, diſagreeing from the True and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church, ſhall be reputed a Capital Enemy to this Kingdom and Common-wealth.</hi> 2. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall Counſel or Adviſe, the taking, or levying the Subſidies of</hi> Tonnage and Poundage; <hi>not being granted by</hi> Parliament, <hi>or ſhall be an Actor or Inſtrument therein, ſhall be likewiſe reputed a Capital Enemy to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi> 3. <hi>If any man ſhall yield voluntarily, or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66116:22"/>pay the ſame; not being granted by</hi> Parliament, <hi>he ſhall be reputed a Betrayer of the Liberties of</hi> England, <hi>and an Enemy to the Commonwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Articles were entertained with the general Approbation of the Members, but were much diſliked by the King, who immediately ſent for the <hi>Serjeant of the Mace</hi> out of the Houſe of Commons, but Sir <hi>Miles Hobart</hi> took the Key from him, and locking the door would not ſuffer him to go forth, at which the King being very much offended, he ſends the Uſher of the Black Rod to diſſolve them, who was not admitted in, whereupon the King, with his Guard of <hi>Penſioners,</hi> were reſolved to force their Entrance; which the <hi>Commons</hi> having notice of, they ſuddenly went all out of the Houſe; and this was the end of this Parliament.</p>
            <p>After their Diſſolution, the King publiſheth a Declaration of the Cauſes thereof; and then que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd Eleven of the Refractory Members at the Council Table, who were all committed to divers Priſons.

            <p>A Paper was about this time diſperſed abroad, containing ſome Projects how the King might Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>The diſſolving the laſt Parliament procured great Animoſities in the People againſt the Prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, which occaſioned divers Invective Libels to be diſperſed abroad, whereof one againſt Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was found in the <hi>Dean</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Yard to this Effect.

            <p>About this time Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi> was ſentenced in the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> to have his Body Whipt, his Fore-head Stigmatized, his Ears Cropt, his Noſe Slit; for publiſhing a Book called <hi>Sions Plea:</hi> wherein he exhorted the late Parliament to ſmite the Biſhops under the Fifth Rib; and called the Queen the Daughter of <hi>Heth,</hi> a <hi>Canaanite</hi> and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: which Sentence was accordingly inflicted on him.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> the Papiſts preſumed on St. <hi>Stephens</hi> day to ſay Maſs in <hi>Dublin,</hi> while the Lords Chief Juſtices were at Church; who having notice thereof, ordered the Preiſts, Crucifixes, and Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be ſeized; and Eight <hi>Popiſh</hi> Aldermen
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66116:25"/>were likewiſe Impriſoned for not Aſſiſting the Mayor; but ſome Papiſts making a Tumult, reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prieſts, whom the Guards again forced to deliver back. Upon Information of this Riot and Inſolency, Fifteen Houſes were by ſpecial Order from the Council ſeized upon for his Majeſties uſe; and the Prieſts and Fryers ſo diſturbed, that two of them hanged themſelves: Neither did the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts agree together, for there were great Conteſts in <hi>England</hi> between the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and Secular <hi>Priests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had many years before marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lady <hi>Howard,</hi> who complaining of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency for Marriage Duties, the Cauſe was brought to a Tryal; and it being made appear by a Jury of Midwives and the Earls own Confeſſion, <hi>That he never could, and believed he never ſhould, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally know her:</hi> Thereupon Sentence of Divorce between him and his Lady was pronounced by the Biſhops: However the Earl was reſolved to try his Fortune once more, and therefore upon his return out of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> where he had been for ſome time a Souldier, he now Married a Daughter of Sir <hi>William Paulet</hi> of <hi>Wiltſhire;</hi> but a while after ſhe objecting the ſame cauſe of complaint, deſired likewiſe to be Divorced from him; which the Earl eaſily couſented to, and it was done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>In the year 1631, and the 7th of his Majeſties Reign, <hi>Mervin</hi> Lord <hi>Audly,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> was Tryed by his Peers upon the Petition of his own Son and Heir, for <hi>Rape and Sodomy;</hi> many unnatural and beaſtly Actions being proved againſt him: whereupon he received Sentence to be Hanged, but had the Favour to be Beheaded at <hi>Tower-hill.</hi> This Earl was born of a very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66116:25"/>Family, and educated in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, but turned Papiſt to have the more liberty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit wickedneſs; in which he grew to ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>height, that he impudently declared in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſome Lords, <hi>As others had their ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, ſome in one thing, ſome in another; ſo his whole Delight was in damning Souls, by enticing Men to ſuch Acts as might ſurely effect it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time Sir <hi>Giles Allington</hi> was Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Marrying his own Niece, and was fined Twelve thouſand Pound to the King, and to give Twenty thouſand Pound Bond never to cohabit, or come in private with his Niece again; and both of them to do Penance at St. <hi>Pauls Croſs,</hi> or St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> which they accordingly did.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Protestants</hi> were very much diſcontented in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were diſcharged from paying the State Penalty of Twelve Pence a Sunday for not going to Church; whereby their Number was wonderfully increaſed: Whereupon the King recalled the Lords Juſtices, who then governed that Kingdom, and ſent Viſcount <hi>Wentworth</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>) thither as Lord Deputy, as judging that theſe diſtempers would be better compoſed under a ſingle Government.</p>
            <p>In the year 1633, and the 9th of his Majeſties Reign, the King made a Journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> attended with ſeveral of the Nobility and Perſons of Quality; and <hi>June</hi> 18 was ſolemnly Crowned King at <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> which Solemnity being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the King calls a Parliament, and paſſeth an Act for Ratification of the old Acts; though ſome affirmed, That the Confirmation of Epiſcopacy was intended thereby, and therefore (though in vain) oppoſed it; upon which ſome of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66116:26"/>became a while after principal Men among the Covenanters: In this <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Parliament, that Nation ſhewed then ſome ſigns of diaffection to the King, by Reaſon of ſeveral Acts which then paſſed; and the generality of the People (who without doubt were influenced by the greater Malecontents) would not ſuffer the Biſhop of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blain,</hi> Dean of the Kings Private Chappel there, to perform Prayers twice a day after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner; neither durſt they receive the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou on their knees, nor wear a Surplice upon <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Holy days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long before his Majeſty went to <hi>Scotland,</hi> being deſirous, if poſſible to have prevented that Trouble, the King writ to a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lord who was intruſted with that Crown, to bring it into <hi>England,</hi> that he might be Crowned here; but the Lord returned Anſwer, <hi>That he durſt not be ſo falſe to his Truſt, but if his Majeſty would be pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof in</hi> Scotland, <hi>he ſhould find thoſe his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ready to yield him the higheſt Honour; but if he ſhould long defer that Duty, they might perbaps be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to make choice of another King.</hi> A very ſtrange and unuſual Anſwer from a Subject to a Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 13, 1633. The Queen was delivered of her Second Son, who was Baptized <hi>James,</hi> and deſigned Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and about that time died <hi>George Abbot</hi> L. Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>William Laud</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was Elected into his place.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1634 the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts were very much Infeſted by Pyrates, and the Fiſhing Trade almoſt ingroſſed by the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty having occaſion for Money to Regain his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Dominion over the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Seas, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66116:26"/>of <hi>Shipmoney</hi> was firſt ſet on foot; and Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General <hi>Noy</hi> being conſulted about it, he out of ſome old Records finds an Ancient Preſident of Raiſing a Tax upon the Nation, by the Authority of the King alone, for ſetting out a Navy in caſe of danger; which was thereupon accordingly put in Execution, and by this Tax the King raiſed by Writ above Twenty thouſand pound a Month, though not without great diſcontent both among the Clergy and Laiety.</p>
            <p>The Diſcontents in <hi>Scotland</hi> began to increaſe, and a Book was publiſhed charging the King with indirect proceedings in the laſt Parliament and a tendancy to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Belief, and to blow up theſe <hi>Scoth</hi> Sparks to a Flame, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> ſent over his Chaplain and another Gentleman, to heighten their Diſcontents: The Author of that Book was ſeized, and found to be abbetted by the Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> the Treacherous Son of a perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Father; who was thereupon Arraigned by his Peers, and Sentenced to Death, but Pardoned by the King.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Gregory Panzani</hi> a Prieſt, was ſen over by the Pope with a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi> to decide the difference between the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> and <hi>Secular</hi> Prieſts, and Inſinuating himſelf into the Favour of the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Windebank,</hi> he endeavours to diſcover how far the King might be perſwaded about giving To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion; as to allow them a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Biſhop to reſide here, but nominated and limited by the King; and that the Pope might ſend a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the Queen; but having made ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between the Jeſuites and Prieſts <hi>Panzani</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and left the further tranſacting of Buſineſs to Seignior <hi>Con,</hi> who ſtaid in his room.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:66116:27"/>
            <p>In the year 1635, A Noble Fleet was fitted out, by the Supply of <hi>Shipmoney,</hi> conſiſting of Forty Sail, under the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> to ſcour the Seas from Pyrates; at which time the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> had confederated againſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> both by Land and Sea; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet removed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> from before <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and the Common People inraged by the <hi>French</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies at Land, roſe up againſt them, and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to expel them the Countrey.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Robert Par</hi> of <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> a Man almoſt an Hundred and threeſcore years old, was this year brought to <hi>London</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> as a Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Miracle, where he dyed ſoon after; though it is very probable he might have lived much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if he had continued at home; for his removal from his own Air, change of Diet, and the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo long a Journey, may be ſuppoſed to have haſtned his end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December,</hi> 23, 1635. the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Kings Second Daughter was born, and to Congratulate the Queens happy delivery, the <hi>Hollander</hi> ſent an Ambaſſador with a preſent of an extraordinary value; that is, a Maſſy Piece of Ambergreece, Two large and almoſt Tranſparent <hi>China</hi> Diſhes; a Clock of moſt excellent Workmanſhip, which was made by <hi>Rodulphus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Germany;</hi> and likewiſe ſeveral curious pieces of Painting.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>William Juxon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> about this time was made Lord Treaſurer in the place of the L. <hi>Weſton</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> deceaſed: And now great differences aroſe about Church matters, chiefly occaſioned by Arch Biſhop <hi>Lauds</hi> ſtrict and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Enjoyning of Ceremonies, as placing the Communion Table at the Eaſt end of the Church, upon an Aſcent with Rails, Altar faſhion; with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66116:27"/>many other things not formerly ſtrictly inſiſted on, and now vehemently oppoſed by thoſe who were uſually called <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> which cauſed them to be charged with Faction; yet ſome of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party Aſſerted, That the Communion Table ought to ſtand in the middle of the Quire, according to the <hi>Primitive</hi> Example; and a Book ſuppoſed to be written by Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> B. of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> was Publiſhed to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty conſidering the good Succeſs of his former Fleet, fits out another in the year 1636, under the command of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who going Northward, ſcowred the Seas of the <hi>Holland</hi> Buſſes, and reduced them to deſire leave of his Maieſty to Fiſh there, which the King upon divers Conſiderations granted them.</p>
            <p>Several Gentlemen of Quality had refuſed to pay the Impoſition of Ship-money and among the reſt Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> upon which his Majeſty refers the whole buſineſs to his Twelve Judges in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 1636; Ten of whom that is, <hi>Brampton, Finch, Davenport, Denham, Jones, Trever, Vernon, Berkly, Crawly, Weſton,</hi> gave their Judgments againſt <hi>Hamden</hi> and his Aſſociates, and ſubſcribed their Names to be Inrolled in all the Courts ol <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall; but <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Crook</hi> refuſed it: This year <hi>March</hi> the 17. the Kings Kings Third Daughter, the Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi> was born.</p>
            <p>In the Thirteenth year of his Majeſties Reign 1637, Dr. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> received a ſevere Cenſure for writing againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and their Government; they being all three Sentenced to pay Five Thouſand Pounds Fine to the King, to loſe their Ears in the Pillory, and to be Impriſoned, which they accordingly ſuffered.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:66116:29"/>taken from him in the firſt year of his Majeſties Reign, he ſo deeply reſented it, that ever after he ſtudied Revenge; and a Bill being preferr'd againſt him in the <hi>Star Chamber</hi> for ſome diſhonourable Speeches of the King, he endeavoured by ſome indirect means to clear his Innocence, and was therefore this year ſentenced Ten thouſand Pounds Fine to the King, Impriſonment in the <hi>Tower,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Pleaſure, to be ſuſpended <hi>ab Officiis, et Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiis,</hi> from his Biſhoprick, and the Profits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to be referred to the <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> Court as to what concerned them.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty deſiring an Uniformity in Religion in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> (a thing before deſigned by King <hi>James</hi>) in purſuance thereof enjoyned the <hi>Scots</hi> the uſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy, the Surplice, and other Habiliments, and began firſt at his own Chappel; and in this year 1637, Proclamation was made that the ſame Order ſhould be obſerved in all Churches, wherewith the Biſhops were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, but not the Kirk, nor the People; who were ſo inraged thereat, that when the Dean of <hi>Edenbourgh</hi> began to Read the Common Prayer in St. <hi>Giles</hi> Church with his Surplice on <hi>July</hi> 13. the Council, Biſhops, Lords, and Magiſtrates, being preſent: the Women, and then the ordinary ſort of men, made ſuch a diſturbance and noiſe with Curſing, Clapping their hands, and ſo great Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that nothing could be heard, but their Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; upon which the Biſhop of <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> who was to preach that day, ſtept up into the Pulpit to reprove them; which increaſing their Fury, they aſſault him with ſuch a ſhower of Stones, Seats, Stools, Cudgels, and whatever elſe was near; that his life was much indangered thereby, and the Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Lord Chancellor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66116:29"/>was like to have been as rudely handled, had not the Provoſt, Bayliffs and others with much trouble turned theſe Rioters out of the Church, the Dean then proceeding to read the <hi>Service Book,</hi> though not without great noiſe from the Multitude about the Church. The like diſturbance happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in other places, but in the Afternoon the <hi>Book</hi> was again read without much trouble; after which ſome of the Diſturbers were ſeized and puniſhed, but with no great Severity; and the Miniſters were promiſed Protection and Maintenance in Reading it; ſo that all at preſent ſeemed calm and quiet, till after Harveſt; at which time ſuch a confluence of People came to <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> as gave juſt cauſe to the Council to fear an Inſurrection; to prevent which they Iſſued out ſeveral Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>That no Church matters ſhould be reſolved on, but that all perſons depart home, unleſs they can ſhew ſome cauſe to the Council, upon pain of Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this was ſo little regarded by the People, that the B. of <hi>Galloway</hi> going the next day to the <hi>Council</hi> was purſued and aſſaulted by them even to the <hi>Council Chamber;</hi> and being with difficulty got in, the Houſe was preſently incompaſſed, and his Perſon peremptorily demanded; upon which thoſe within required Aid of the Provoſt and Council of <hi>Edenbourgh;</hi> but their Condition was as bad, being likewiſe beſet in their Town houſe by the People, who would not let them go out till they had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, 1. <hi>To joyn in Oppoſition to the Service Book, and in Petitioning to that purpoſe.</hi> 2. <hi>To restore two or three of their ſilenced Ministers.</hi> Which being rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Council, the Lord <hi>Traqnair</hi> and another, went in Perſon to the Town Houſe, where they found the Tumult ſomewhat quieted by thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions; but in coming back, they were furiouſly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66116:30"/>aſſaulted in the <hi>Graſs-ſtreet,</hi> and the L. <hi>Traquair</hi> was trodden under foot, his Hat, Cloak, and white Wand, was taken away, and himſelf halled to the Council Houſe: The Lords whereof weighing their own danger, ſent ſecretly to ſome of thoſe Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen who diſliked the <hi>Service Book,</hi> and were then aſſembled in the common cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; by whom they were ſafely guarded through the multitude, to their ſeveral Houſes.</p>
            <p>And now judging themſelves ſecure, they make Proclamation <hi>for breaking up all Conventions and keeping the Peace,</hi> which had the contrary effect. Two Petitions being preſented to them.

            <p>The next year 1638, the <hi>Scots</hi> entred inta a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant</hi> to preſerve the Religion there proteſt, reſolving to maintain it; and to that purpoſe, they ſent for General <hi>Leſly</hi> and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers from beyond Sea, providing themſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with Arms and Ammunition; whilſt D. <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who was appointed to allay theſe heats and Diſtempers, ſeemed ſecretly to foment them, by ſpending a great deal of time in Declarations,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66116:30"/>Proclamations, Meſſages and Letters; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards makes ſuch Propoſitions to the <hi>Confederates</hi> about calling a <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> as were very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſteful to the <hi>Covenanters</hi> and increaſed their Fury: Whereupon <hi>Hamilton</hi> obtained of the King the Sole and Unlimited Power of Managing that Affair, and then acquainted them with a Declaration which he had procured of the King; <hi>That he did diſcharge the Service Book, Book of Canons, and high Commiſſion and likewiſe did annul and reſcind all Acts for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing them, and did diſcharge the urging the Practice of the Five Articles of</hi> Perth: <hi>and that all Perſons whomſoever ſhall be liable to the Cenſure of Parliament, General Aſſembly, or any other Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; according to the Nature of the Offence, That the Ancient Confelſion of Faith and Band annexed, ſhall be ſubſcribed and received as in K.</hi> James <hi>time.</hi> That a <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> be holden at <hi>Glafcow, Nov.</hi> 21. 1638, and a <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Edenbourgh</hi> May, 15. 1639, All former Offences to be pardoned, and a <hi>General Faſt</hi> appointed.</p>
            <p>This Declaration being publiſhed, the Marqueſs and Council ſubſcribed the <hi>Covenanters Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. yet ſtill ſome matter remained for a <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> which was read by one <hi>Johnſon;</hi> wherein the People were exhorted to conſider with whom they had to deal: and exceptions were made againſt Biſhops, and their Voting in the <hi>Aſſembly:</hi> After this they Elect Commiſſioners for the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> whom they moved to cite the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops to appear there, as Guilty Perſons; which being refuſed, they themſelves preſent a Bill of Complaint againſt them to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery at <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> who accordingly warned them to appear at the next <hi>General Aſſembly:</hi> At their Meeting the Biſhops ſent in a Proteſtation againſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66116:31"/>their <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> which the Covenanters would not vouchſafe to read, but preſumed to forbid Six Lords of the Privy Council to fit in their <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> though nominated by the King. His Majeſty having notice of their proceedings, as to the Biſhops, and other matters, ordered their <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to be diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was done accordingly <hi>Nov.</hi> 21. 1638; and the Covenanters immediately according to their uſual method, Iſſued out a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> againſt it, and likewiſe declared 6 former Meetings (which were oppoſite to their ways) to be void and of none Effect; and ſoon after they aboliſhed <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and then prepared for a War, as being ſenſible that the King would maintain the Rights of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and would likewiſe ſtrictly call them to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their late Tranſactions.</p>
            <p>About this time a Letter was ſent by the <hi>Scots</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to implore his Aſſiſtance, Signed by ſeveral of the Nobility. The King of <hi>England</hi> prepares an Army for <hi>Scotland,</hi> with which in the year 1639 he marcheth in Perſon into the North; but while he ſtayed at <hi>York</hi> ſome of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility tampered with the <hi>Eagliſh,</hi> telling them that the ruin of the <hi>Scots</hi> would enable the King to be more ſevere toward his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects; by which Intelligence and Correſpondence it was evident that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had no mind to Fight, though their Army was much ſtronger than the <hi>Scots;</hi> whereupon by the Mediation of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a Treaty of Peace was begun, and ſoon finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; wherein it was agreed, That His Majeſty ſhould publiſh a Declaration, whereby all ſhould be confirmed which his Commiſſioners had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his Name, That a <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> and a <hi>Parliament</hi> be held at <hi>Edenbourgh</hi> in a ſhort time. And laſtly, That upon disbanding their Forces,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66116:31"/>diſſolving their Councils, and reſtoring the King to his Forts and Caſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the King was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call his Fleet and Forces, and make reſtitution of their Goods ſince the Breach.</p>
            <p>The Kings Declaration was no ſooner publiſhed, but the <hi>Covenanters</hi> ſet forth another <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> for adhereing to there <hi>Aſſembly</hi> at <hi>Glaſco,</hi> and their <hi>Covenant;</hi> whereupon the King, who intended to be preſent at their <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> not finding the <hi>Scots</hi> punctual in performing Articles, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they would treat of ſome matters diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, goes into <hi>England;</hi> after which the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> ſate at <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> and aboliſhed <hi>Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> the <hi>Liturgy, High Commiſſion,</hi> and <hi>Book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons;</hi> and then made ſeveral demands of the King of a various nature.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty underſtanding how things went, and that the <hi>Scots</hi> levyed Taxes and prepared Arms, he commanded by his Commiſſioner, the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> that their <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould be Adjourned for ſome time; but the <hi>Covenanters</hi> declared againſt this Command, and ſent a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance to the King; and afterward <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Traquair,</hi> likewiſe came to <hi>London,</hi> where there were ſuch proceedings, as did the more exaſperate the jarring parties againſt each other.</p>
            <p>In this year 1639, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet of near Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sail, and Twenty five thouſand Men, deſigned to be landed at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> for the relief of <hi>Flanders,</hi> were ſet upon by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and Eleven of them taken and ſent into <hi>Holland;</hi> three periſhed upon the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> one near <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and five were ſunk in the Fight. What the real intent of this Fleet was, is yet uncertain; for it ſeemed unlikely that Twenty five thouſand Men ſhould be ſent only for a Recruit, and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66116:32"/>refuſing to ſhew his Commiſſion when requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereto by the King, makes it ſeem yet mon ſuſpicious.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners having delivered their Meſſage, return home to <hi>Edenbourgh, Nov.</hi> 19. 1639. the ſame night that a great part of the Caſtle Walls fell down, and the Anniverſary of the King Birth day. A while after the King ſent the Lord <hi>Eſtrich,</hi> and others, to tepair the Walls, who were reſiſted by the <hi>Covenanters;</hi> as not judging the Lord <hi>Eſtrich</hi> to be a fit Governour for the Caſtle; which Office was deſigned him by the King. The King being hereat extreamly offended, reſolved, ſince fair means would not prevail, to force the <hi>Scots</hi> to reaſon, and to that end conſiders how to make proviſions for Men and Money; and calling a ſecret Cabinet Council, conſiſting only of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> (who drove on his own particular intereſt) it was concluded. <hi>That for the Kings ſupply a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be called in</hi> England, <hi>and another in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but becauſe the Debates of Parliament would take up ſome time, it was reſolved, that the Lords ſhould ſubſcribe to lend the King money. The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> ſubſcribed Twenty thouſand pound, the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> as much; but <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> pretended poverty. preſerving his money for other uſes; the reſt of the Lords, Judges, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and other Dependants, and many of the Gentry, yea, even ſeveral <hi>Popiſh</hi> Recuſants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed according to their ability.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> on the other ſide fore-ſeeing the ſtorm, prepared for their own Defence, making Treaties in <hi>Denmark, Sweden, Holland</hi> and <hi>Poland;</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are never idle, did likewiſe endeavour to foment the differences; to which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66116:32"/>end <hi>Con</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> Sir <hi>Toby Matthews, Read</hi> and <hi>Maxwell,</hi> two <hi>Scots,</hi> endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the diſcontented People, <hi>That the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to iuſlave them to his will and pleaſure.</hi> Which practices of theirs were diſcovered by <hi>Andreas Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernſfield,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who declared, That many of the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> and chief Favourites at Court, were conſenting to theſe Tranſactions, and particularly the Earl and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Arundel,</hi> Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> and <hi>Endymion Porter. Con</hi> alſo performed the part of a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand, as all his Succeſſors, the Popes Nuncio's that came after him, did likewiſe; and had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly offered a Cardinals Cap to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the Popes Name.</p>
            <p>In the year 1640, and the Sixteenth of the King, a Parliament was called at <hi>Weſtminster, April</hi> 13. in which the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was highly honoured for his good ſervice in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in obtaining four Subſidies, to maintain Ten thouſand Foot, and Fifteen hundred Horſe. And that <hi>England</hi> might follow this Example, the King tells the Parliament, that if they would ſupply him, ſo as to ſuppreſs the Inſolencies of the <hi>Scots,</hi> he would acquit his claim to <hi>Shipmoney,</hi> and giue ſatisfaction to their juſt Demands. By which Propoſals the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ſenſible of the Kings Neceſſities, and therefore required ſatisfaction, 1. <hi>For clearing the Property of the Subject.</hi> 2. <hi>For eſtabliſhing the True Religion.</hi> 3. <hi>For Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whilſt they were debating whether the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the People or the Kings Supply ſhould be firſt conſidered, and Matters were in an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful poſture, Secretary <hi>Vane,</hi> either accidentally, or on purpoſe, overthrew all at once, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66116:33"/>that the King required Twelve Subſidies whereas he at that time only deſired Six; which ſo much inraged the Houſe, and made things ſo ill that by the Advice of the <hi>Junto</hi> the Parliament was diſſolved, having only ſate Twenty two days; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Privy Councel likewiſe adviſed their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, being aſſured the heats in the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> were ſo great, that they intended that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to have voted againſt the War with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> whereby the King would have been in a worſe condition than before their ſitting.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time a Convocation of Biſhops ſate, with Commiſſion to make ſuch Canons as they judged for the peace of the Church; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, they impoſed an Oath called, <hi>&amp;c. (Et cetera)</hi> as an Anticovenant againſt the <hi>Scots;</hi> which becauſe it occaſioned much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, may not be unfitly inſerted.</p>
            <p>I A. B. <hi>Do ſwear that I do approve the Doctrine and Diſcipline or Government eſtabliſhed in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as containing all things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and that I will not endeavour, by my ſelf, or any other, directly or indirectly, to bring in any</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh <hi>Doctrine, contrary to that ſo eſtabliſhed; nor will I ever give my conſent to alter the Government of this Church by Archbiſhops, Deans, and Arch Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons — &amp;c.</hi> (Et cetera, <hi>and ſo forth</hi>) <hi>as it ſtands now eſtabliſhed, and as by right it ought to ſtand, nor yet ever to ſubject it to the Uſurpations and Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the See of</hi> Rome: <hi>And all theſe things do I plainly and ſincerely acknowledge and ſwear, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the plain and common ſenſe or underſtanding of the ſame words, without any Equivocation mental E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, or ſecret Reſervation whatſoever. And this I do heartily, willingly and truly, upon the faith of a Chriſtian.</hi> So help me God in Jeſus Chriſt. This
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66116:33"/>Oath was impoſed upon all Miniſters, and gave great Offence. This was the chief buſineſs of this Convocation, which ended <hi>May</hi> 26, 1640.</p>
            <p>Arch Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> by his earneſt proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Nonconformiſts and ſuch as were called <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> and by his ſtrict enjoyning of Ceremonies, eſpecially reviving old Ceremonies, which had not been lately obſerved, procured much hatred to himſelf from the People, particularly the <hi>Londiners,</hi> who had a particular diſguſt againſt him, for his ſeverity upon Mr. <hi>Burton, Pryn,</hi> and <hi>Baſtwick;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that upon <hi>May</hi> 9, 1640, a Paper was fixed upon the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> inciting the Apprentices to riſe and ſack his Houſe at <hi>Lambeth</hi> the Monday after; which they were the more inclined to do, becauſe it was reported that he was the chief inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator of the King to diſſolve the laſt Parliament; but the Arch Biſhop had notice of their Deſign, and provided accordingly; however, upon Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at midnight about Five Hundred of them beſet his Houſe, and endeovoured to enter, but were repulſed, and forced to depart; having in ſome meaſure vented their Spleen in words, and breaking his Glaſs-Windows. The next day many of them were apprehended and impriſoned, but three days after they were forcibly reſcued from thence by their Companions, who broke open the Priſon doors; for which one of the Ring-leaders was drawn, hanged and quartered, and his head and quarters ſet upon <hi>London</hi>-Bridge.</p>
            <p>The King grew daily more offended againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and calls a Select <hi>Juncto</hi> to conſult about them, where the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> delivered his mind in ſuch Terms as were afterward made uſe of to his diſtruction; War againſt them was reſolved on, and Money was to be procured one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

            </p>
            <p>The Parliament having now removed their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and increaſing in Reputation, were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bill for a <hi>Triennial Parliament;</hi> for promoting which, Petitions came from divers places, one whereof was ſubſcribed with 800 Hands directly againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which the King took notice of; and calling both Houſes together, tells them, <hi>Of their ſlowneſs and the charge of Two Armies in the Kingdom, and that he would have them avoid two Rocks, the one about the Hierachy of Biſhops, which he was willing to Reform but not to alter; The other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning frequent Parliaments, which he liked well, but not to give his Power to</hi> Sheriffs <hi>and</hi> Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
            <p>About this time one <hi>Goodman</hi> a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſt, condemned at the Seſſions in <hi>London,</hi> was repriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King; upon which both Houſes petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to know who were the Inſtruments of it; and receiving an unſatisfactory Anſwer, they Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt the Toleration of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Popes</hi> Nuncio <hi>Roſetti,</hi> and this <hi>Goodman,</hi> whom they deſired might be left to the Juſtice of the Law, To this the King anſwers, <hi>That the increaſe of Popery and Papiſts in his Dominions, is extreamly againſt his mind, and that he would uſe all poſſible means for the reſtraining of it: As for the Popes</hi> Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio Roſetti, <hi>he had no Commiſſion, but only to preſerve Correſpondence between the Queen and the Pope, which was allowed her by the Articles of Marriage, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66116:38"/>he had prevailed with her to remove him and is contented to remit the particular Caſe of</hi> Goodman <hi>to both Houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> had been now quartered in <hi>England</hi> five months, during which a Ceſſation had been concluded at <hi>Rippon,</hi> but the full Pacification was reſerved for <hi>London,</hi> where Commiſſioners ſate on both Parties to hear the Demands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to make anſwer thereunto. After which the <hi>Scots</hi> preſented the great Account of their Charges, which was Five hundred fourteen thouſand, one hundred twenty eight pounds nine Shillings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the loſs of their Nation, which was Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty thouſand pounds. This Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtartled the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners, till the <hi>Scots</hi> told them, <hi>They did not give in that Account as expecting a Total Reparation of their Charges and Loſſes, but were content to bear a part of it; hoping for the rest, from the Juſtice and Kindneſs of</hi> England, There was ſome oppoſition made to the Demands, however Moneys were raiſed for the preſent from the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the Supply of both the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Armies, as the Parliament had done once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>At this time a Match was propounded between the young Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Daughter to the King, which his Majeſty li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked well of, and communicated it to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; with whom it found an unanimous and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reception, in regard of the Alliance to be thereupon concluded with the <hi>States General;</hi> and likewiſe that he was of the ſame <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> ſo that the Marriage was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>Preſently after four Members of the Commons delivered a Meſſage to the Lords of a <hi>Popiſh Deſign</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:66116:38"/>of Levying an Army of Fifteen thouſand in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and Eight thouſand in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that the main promoters thereof were the Earls of <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Worceſter.</hi>

            <p>In <hi>February</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Berkly,</hi> one of the Judges about <hi>Ship-money,</hi> was accuſed of High Treaſon, and committed Priſoner to the Black Rod. In this Month the King paſſed that Act for a <hi>Triennial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and to let them know what value he put upon this great favour his Majeſty told the Two Houſes, <hi>That hitherto they had gone on in thoſe things which concerned themſelves, and now he expected they ſhould proceed upon what concerned him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King then likewiſe ſigned the Bill of <hi>Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> which gave them ſuch univerſal content, that Sir <hi>Edward Littleton</hi> Lord Keeper, was ordered <hi>To return the Humble Thanks of Both Houſes to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> Upon which there were Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires and Bells ringing in and about <hi>London,</hi> in the ſame manner as formerly upon granting the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi>

            <p>Upon <hi>Monday March</hi> 26, 1640. the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> Tryal began in <hi>Westminſter-hall,</hi> the King, Queen, and Prince being preſent; and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> likewiſe being there as a Committee at the managing their Accuſation; the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was Lord High Steward, and the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> Lord High Conſtable, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> though he had but ſhort warning, yet had gotten his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ready againſt the time. The Accuſation was managed by Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> conſiſting of Twenty eight Articles, to moſt of which the Earl made Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Replies.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Commons</hi> were reſolved to proſecute him to the utmoſt, and had therefore procured the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Ireland</hi> to proſecute him there alſo, as guilty of High Treaſon; which being unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced, extorted from the Earl this paſſionate Expreſſion, <hi>That there was a Conſpiracy againſt him, to take away his Life.</hi> At which the <hi>Commons</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt him, <hi>That standing Impeached of High Treaſon, he durſt accuſe the Parliament of two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Conſpiracy againſt him.</hi> But beſides all theſe, certain notes were produced againſt him, which were taken by Sir <hi>H. Vane</hi> in a cloſe Committee of ſelect Counſellors, whom the King had choſen to conſult about his ſecond Expedition againſt the <hi>Scots;</hi> out of which it was alledged againſt the Earl, <hi>That he had given the King advice to borrow an Hundred thouſand pound of the City of</hi> London, <hi>To levy Ship-money rigorouſly; and that his Majeſty having tryed the Affections of his People, was abſolved and looſed from all Rules of Government, and might do what power would admit; and having an Army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>might imploy it for the reducing of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he was ſure could not hold out five months: And</hi> London <hi>being full of the Nobility, the</hi> Commiſſion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66116:39"/>of Array <hi>was to be ſet on foot, and all Oppoſers thereof to be ſeverely dealt with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Earl replyed, <q>That he conceived it lawful for a Privy Counſellor to have freedom of Voting with others; and as to the matter of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, he thought that the ſingle Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of one man (Secretary <hi>Vane</hi>) was not of Validity in Law, much leſs in Life and Death, and that the Depoſitions of Secretary <hi>Vane</hi> was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as appeared by ſeveral Examinations, and that there were preſent at the Debate but eight Privy Counſellors, whereof two were not to be produced, and four others declared upon their Honours that they never heard him ſpeak thoſe words, or any like them; and laſtly that if he had ſpoken them (which he yet granted not) that the word <hi>This</hi> Kingdom, could not imply <hi>England,</hi> the debate being concerning <hi>Scotland,</hi> there being not the leaſt intention of Landing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army in <hi>England;</hi> and concluded his Defence with tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Lords, that he was accuſed as guilty of Treaſon for endeavouring to ſubvert the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of the Land, but it ſeemed ſtrange to him that it ſhould be Treaſon together which was not Treaſon in any part; and laſtly, deſired the Lords to conſider how their own Priviledges, and other Miniſters of State, would ſuffer by his Condemnation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Commons</hi> muſt now juſtifie their Charge by Law, to which end they produced the <hi>Salvo</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Stat. of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. The words were theſe, <hi>Becauſe all particular Treaſons could not be then defined; therefore what the Parliament ſhould declare to be Treaſon, in time to come ſhould be puniſhed as Treaſon;</hi> And ſo this <hi>Salvo</hi> was to be the Ground work of the <hi>Bill of Attainder.</hi> This being a point of Law, the Earl had Council allowed him, who anſwered
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66116:40"/>on his behalf, <hi>That the Statute which they cited was but a Declarative and a Penal Law, awd would no way admit of ſuch Conſequential and Inferential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and that this</hi> Salvo <hi>was repealed by an Act of Parliament in the Sixth of</hi> Henry <hi>the fourth.</hi> And ſo the Court Adjourned without prefixing any time of Meeting; for the Commons proceeded to diſpatch their <hi>Bill of Attainder,</hi> and <hi>April</hi> 19, 1641, they Voted the Earl Guilty of High Treaſon, upon the Evidence of Secretary <hi>Vane</hi> and his Notes; And upon the 25th. they paſſed the Bill and ſent to the Lords for their Concurrence, to whom it ſeemed at firſt ſo perplext a buſineſs, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were forced to ſend Mr. <hi>Saint John</hi> the Kings Sollicitor, to confer with them about it, who gave them ſuch ſatisfaction, that thence forward they ſhewed greater propenſity to the Earls Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Commons petitioned the King, 1. <hi>To remove all Papists from Court.</hi> 2. <hi>For diſarming of them generally throughout the Kingdom.</hi> 3. <hi>For disbanding the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Army.</hi> To which the King anſwered, 1. <hi>They all knew what Legal Truſt the Crown hath in that particular, therefore he ſhall not need to ſay any thing to aſſure them that he ſhall uſe it ſo, as there ſhall be no juſt cauſe of ſcandal.</hi> 2. <hi>As for the ſecond he is content it ſhall be done by Law. And for the last, he had entred into Conſultation about it, finding many difficulties therein, and doth ſo wiſh the disbanding of all Armies, as he did conjure them ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and heartily to joyn with him in disbanding thoſe two here,</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi> Engliſh.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons having finiſhed their <hi>Bill of Attainder</hi> againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the King fearing the Concluſion, and being willing to do ſome good Office to him, His Majeſty <hi>May</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:66116:40"/>1, 1641, calls both Houſes together, and in a Speech tells them, <hi>That he had been preſent at the hearing of that great Cauſe, and that in his Conſcience, poſitively he could not condemn him of High Treaſon, and yet could not clear him of miſdemeanours; but hoped a way might be found out to ſatisfie Justice and their fears without oppreſſing his Conſcience.</hi> And ſo he diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to their great diſcontent, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated ſo far, that <hi>May</hi> 3. near a Thouſand Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, moſt of them armed with Swords, Cudgels, and Staves, came thronging down to <hi>Westminſter,</hi> crying out for <hi>Justice againſt the Earl of</hi> Strafford; eſpecially applying themſelves to the Earl of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery,</hi> Lord Chamberlain by whoſe perſwaſions, and promiſes their fury was partly abated: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they poſted upon the Gate at <hi>Westminster</hi> a Liſt of the Names of thoſe who would have acquitted the Earl, whom they ſtiled <hi>Staffordians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament being Informed that ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours were uſed, to raiſe a Diſguſt in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Northern Army againſt their Proceedings, they now enter into a National Proteſtation to maintain with Life, Power, and Eſtate the True Reformed <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt all Popery and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Innovations: Which was ordered to be printed and publiſhed through the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 5. The Lords acquainted the Commons, <hi>That they thought it the ſafest courſe to lay by the</hi> Bill of Attainder, <hi>becauſe it brought in the King for Judge:</hi> And the next day they debated the ſeveral Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of his Impeachment, and voted the Earl guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of High Treaſon upon Two of them, that is the 15th. <hi>For Levying of moneys in</hi> Ireland <hi>by force in a Warlike manner;</hi> And the 16th, <hi>For Impoſing an Oath upon the Subjects of</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:66116:41"/>
            <p>The Commons had now finiſhed a Bill, <hi>For the Continuance of the Parliament;</hi> which having paſſed the Lords, was tendred to the King to be ſigned; together with the <hi>Bill of Attainder,</hi> His Majeſty anſwered, That on Monday following he would ſatisfie them; and on the Sunday before the King ſpent the whole day in conſulting about the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> with the Judges and Biſhops: The Judges told him, <hi>That in point of Law (according to the Oath made by</hi> Sir H. Vane <hi>of the Earls advice, to raiſe Horſe to awe this Nation) he was guilty of Treaſon.</hi> In the evening the Five Biſhops, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Armagh, London, Durham, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Carliſle,</hi> were called in to the King to ſatisfie his Conſcience about it, who all agreed, <hi>That the King might ſhew mercy without any ſcruple, and that he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Earl, if he did not think him Guilty:</hi> This was to matter of Fact, but as to matter of Law, <hi>He was to reſt in the Opinion of the Judges.</hi>

            <p>Monday <hi>May</hi> 10. The King gives Commiſſion to ſeveral Lords to paſs Two Bills, one the <hi>Bill of Attainder</hi> againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford:</hi> The other, <hi>For Continuing the Parliament during the pleaſure of both Houſes;</hi> Which laſt Act was occaſioned for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the <hi>Scots,</hi> who required Vaſt Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and for disbanding both the Armies: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by great Taxes were laid upon the People by Act of Parliament, which could not poſſibly be levied in a ſhort time, and therefore there needed a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Supply from the City of <hi>London,</hi> who (as it was alledged) would not part with their money, leaſt a Diſſolution of the Parliament ſhould happen before payment; upon which Account the King was preſſed to paſs this Act.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the Bill was paſſed againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the King ſent Sir <hi>Dudley Carlton,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:66116:41"/>Secretary of State, to acquaint the Earl with what was done, and the motives thereto, whereat the Earl was greatly aſtoniſht; but the next day the King being troubled, writes a Letter with his own hand to the Houſe of Lords, and ſent it by the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> telling them, <hi>That whereas Juſtice had been ſatisfied in his Condemnation, an intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mercy would not now be unſeaſonable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſired them, that if it might be done without any diſcontent to the People, the Earl might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fulfil the Natural Courſe of his Life in cloſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, ſequeſtred from all Publick Affairs, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he never attempted to make an Eſcape; however he thought it a work of Charity to repreive him till Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday.</hi> But nothing could be obtained in favour of him, but that the Lords ſaid, <hi>Their Intention was to be ſuitors to His Majeſty to ſhew favour to his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Children, and that whatever proviſion himſelf had made for them, it might be confirmed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Deſigns were ſaid to have been laid for his Eſcape, however <hi>May</hi> 12, 1641, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was conveyed from the Tower by a Guard conſiſting of the Trained Bands, Marſhals men, Sheriffs Officers, and Warders of the Tower. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him went his Gentleman-Uſher bare headed, and he himſelf followed, accompanied with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> and others. As he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long he paſſed by Arch-biſhop <hi>Lauds</hi> Lodging, and ſpying him at the Window, he called to him for his Prayers and his Bleſſing; but the Biſhop at the ſight of him was ſo ſurpriz'd that for ſome time he could not recollect himſelf, and being reprehended by his Friends of an undecent Puſillanimity, He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; <hi>That he doubted not but when that bitter Cup ſhould come to his turn, he ſhould taste it with a most Chriſtian Courage,</hi>

After which he kneeled down to Prayer, and riſing up again took his laſt leave of his Brother Sir <hi>George Wentworth</hi> and all his Friends, ſending his Love to his Wife, and his Bleſſing to his Children; with a moſt ſtrict Injunction to His Onely Son, <hi>Never to meddle with the Patrimony of the Church:</hi> And the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was the end of that Great and Able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State, who is reported when he heard the, King had conſented to the <hi>Bill of Attainder,</hi> to have lift up his Eyes to Heaven, and clapping his hand upon his heart, to have cried out (perhaps in immitation of Cardinal <hi>Woolſeys</hi> Complaint) <hi>Put not your Truſt in Princes nor in the Sons of Men, for in them is no Salvation.</hi> And indeed it ſeemed very hard that he ſhou'd be made guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by a Bill framed on purpoſe, without former
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66116:42"/>Preſident; and to which His Majeſties Conſent was in a manner extorted, and which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bewailed with great remorſe of Conſcience, though it is ſaid the King was not ſo much convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any thing ſaid to him, but the chief Motive was a Letter from the Earl, wherein he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>Sir, <hi>(To ſet your Majeſty's Conſcience at Liberty) I do moſt humbly beſeech you, for the Preventing of ſuch miſchiefs as may happen by your refuſal to paſs the</hi> Bill, <hi>by this means to remove praiſed be God (I cannot ſay this accurſed but) this Unfortunate</hi> Thing, <hi>forth of the way, towards that bleſſed Agreement which God I truſt ſhall forever establiſh between You and Your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. My conſent herein ſhall more acquit you to God, then all the world can do beſide: To a willing man there is no injury done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Character is Expreſſed by the King his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in his <hi>Eikon Baſilike,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>He looked upon the Earl of</hi> Strafford <hi>as a Gentleman whoſe great Abilities might make a Prince rather afraid than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to Imploy him in the greateſt Affairs of State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fall of this powerful man ſo ſtartled other great Officers of State, that ſeveral reſigned their places: About the ſame time ſome diſcontents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe between the Parliament and the Engliſh Army in the <hi>North,</hi> but a while after both Armies were disbanded. The payment of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> had been much queſtioned ſince 1628, but now the King at the requeſt of the Commons was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to relinquiſh his Claim to it, and afterward paſied <hi>a Bill for Pole-money, and two others for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the Star chamber and High Commiſſion Courts;</hi> which had proceeded with too much ſeverity, having ſo far out grown the power of the Law, that they would not be limited nor gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by it.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:66116:43"/>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 5. A Charge was brought into the Houſe of Commons againſt Dr. <hi>Wren</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> being accuſed of ſome Treaſonable Miſdemeanors in his Dioceſs; who thereupon Voted him unworthy and unfit to hold or exerciſe any Office or Dignity in Church or State, and deſired the Lords to join with them, to requeſt the King for his Removal from his ſervice; and ſo he was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and about the ſame time the Writs for <hi>Ship money,</hi> and all the Proceedings therein were by the Kings conſent adjudged void; and 5. of the Judges that gave their Opinions for it, were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached of high miſdemeanors; that is <hi>Bramston, Trevor, Weſton, Davenport,</hi> and <hi>Crawly;</hi> and <hi>Berkly</hi> another of the Judges was accuſed for Treaſon, but no further proſecution was made therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>August</hi> 6. Both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Armies were disbanded, and four-days after the King went toward <hi>Scotland</hi> and was entertained with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of Affection by that Nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſeveral Places of Honour and Power upon divers of them; confirming likewiſe the Treaty between the two Nations by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 23, 1641. A Horrid and Notorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion broke out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was managed with ſuch ſecrecy, that it was not diſcovered till the night before it was to have been put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which was in divers places carried on with ſuch fury, that Two hundred thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, Women, and Children, were in a ſhort ſpace barbarouſly murdered by all manner of moſt cruel torments that their Devliſh minds could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. And this was chiefly occaſioned by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Popiſh Prieſts, Monks, and Fryers, who every where declaimed loudly againſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66116:43"/>the Proteſtants, ſaying, <hi>That they were Hereticks, and not to be ſuffered any longer to live amongst them, That it was no more ſin to kill one of them then to kill a dog; and that it was a mortal and unpardonable ſin to relieve or protect any of them.</hi> Yea the Prieſts gave the Sacrament to divers of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> upon Condition they ſhould ſpare neither Man, Woman, nor Child of the Proteſtants, ſaying, <hi>That it did them a great deal of good to waſh their hands in their blood; and that they were worſe than Dogs; and if any of them died in the Quarrel, before their bodies were cold, their ſouls ſhould be in Heaven without ever calling in at</hi> Purgatory <hi>by the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bloody Rebellion happened in a time wherein the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had all the Priviledges and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they could reaſonably expect, and the ancient hatred which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had born to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did now ſeem to be forgotten, Forty Years of Peace having compacted and cemented them together, both by Alliances and Marriages, which were all now miſerably broken and deſtroyed. The Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> wherein were Ten thouſand Arms, and all other Forts and Magazines in the Kingdom, were to have been ſurprized, and all the <hi>Engliſh Protestants</hi> that would not joyn with them, were to be murdered; but the ſeizing of the Caſtle was happily prevented by one <hi>Owen Conally,</hi> from ſome diſcourſe accidentally in a Tavern with one <hi>Hugh Mac Mahon,</hi> Grandſon to the Great Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> the night before the intended Execution.</p>
            <p>Upon this Diſcovery <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> and Lord <hi>Mac-Guire,</hi> were ſeized by the Lord Chief Juſtices of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and many Principal Conſpirators eſcaped that night out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſo was <hi>Dublin</hi> ſaved, that all <hi>Ireland</hi> might not be loſt in one day. But the horrid Deſign was paſt prevention as to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66116:44"/>for the Conſpirators were in Arms at the day appointed in all the Counties round about, and poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants daily arrived there, robbed and ſpoiled of all they had; giving lamentable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations how their Houſes were ſeized, the Towns and Villages fired, and in all parts all manner of cruel Outrages and Villanies committed. The Lords Juſtices Sir <hi>William Parſons</hi> and Sir <hi>John Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> taking thoſe Arms which they found in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and Arming whom they could to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſent Sir <hi>Henry Spotſwood</hi> to the King then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with an Account of all that happened, who diſpatched Sir <hi>James Stuart</hi> with Inſtructions to the Lords of the Privy Council in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to carry all the Money his preſent Stores would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. He likewiſe moved the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as being neareſt) for their aſſiſtance, but they excuſed it, becauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> was a dependant upon the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> but if the State of <hi>England</hi> would uſe any of their men for that ſervice, they would make Propoſitions in order to it. At the ſame time likewiſe, the King ſent Poſt to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and a while after <hi>Owen O Conally</hi> the Firſt Diſcoverer of the Plot, came to <hi>London</hi> and brought Letters to the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (who was choſen Deputy, but not yet gone over) wherein the Lords Juſtices deſired ſome Reward might be given him; upon which the Parliament Voted him a Gift of 500 <hi>l.</hi> and an Annuity of 200 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and at a Conference of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they paſſed ſeveral Votes for the Relief of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet little was done till the Kings return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was about the end of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to diſhearten the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from any reſiſtance, bragged, <hi>That the Queen was with their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66116:44"/>Army, That the King would come amongſt them alſo, and aſiſt them; That they did but maintain his Cauſe againſt the</hi> Puritans: <hi>That they had the Kings Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for what they did</hi> (ſhewing indeed a Patent themſelves had drawn, but thereto was affixed an Old Broad Seal which had been taken from an Ancient Patent out of <hi>Farnham</hi> Abby by one <hi>Plunket</hi> in the preſence of many of their Lords and Prieſts, as was afterwards atteſted by the Confeſſion of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral:) <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>were in the Confederacy with them;</hi> And to ſeem to confirm this laſt, they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained for ſome time from deſtroying the Eſtates or murdering any of that Nation: And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide, to incourage the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> they produced pretended Letters; wherein they ſaid they were informed from <hi>England, That the Parliament had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Act, all the</hi> Iriſh <hi>ſhould be compelied to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant worſhip,</hi> and for the firſt offence in refuſing, to forfeit all their Goods, for the ſecond their Eſtates, and for the third their Lives; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this they preſented them with the hopes of Liberty, <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Yoke ſhould be stricken off; That they ſhould have a King of their own Nation, and that then all the Goods and Eſtates of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhould be divided amongſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe Motives of Spoil and Liberty, which were ſtrengthned by the former, of Religion, the Rebellion increaſed. The Rebels in <hi>Ulſter</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal,</hi> aſſiſted by his Brother, the Brother of the Lord <hi>Mac Guire, Philip O Reley,</hi> and ſeveral others, had poſſeſſed moſt of the ſtrong places in that Province; and many other, which they could not take by force nor treachery, were delivered to them by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon Articles, which they afterwards like true (or rather falſe) Papiſts, moſt perfidiouſly broke; Butchering and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66116:45"/>Maſſacring the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> without pity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to Age or Sex; though they ſtill ſpared the <hi>Scotch</hi> Plantations in <hi>Ulster,</hi> becauſe of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and likewiſe for fear of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, ſo eaſily to be tranſported to the North parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> But now their General Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal</hi> (one of the Race of the late Bloody Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> (a pretended <hi>Proteſtant</hi> till ſome time before) having got together a vaſt number of the Natives, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and deſtroyed their Houſes and Goods; and though they did not exerciſe that Cruelty on their Bodies, yet they ſtript them and drove them Naked to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Shore; from thence he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into other parts, and took <hi>Dundalk,</hi> incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Arde</hi> near <hi>Tredagh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King finding his ſtay to be longer than he thought left the whole buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who declared a ſpeedy and vigorous Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Voted Fifty thouſand Pound for a preſent Supply: By which time the Lords of the Council of <hi>Ireland</hi> had Armed as many as were able, and given Commiſſions for raiſing ſeveral Regiments, of whom the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> was made Lieutenant General, and a Regiment was ſent from <hi>England</hi> under Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt;</hi> about which time the King return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was Entertained and Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>London,</hi> and from thence Conducted to <hi>White-Hall:</hi> after which the King Treated ſeveral Chief Citizens at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> where divers of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen had the honour of Knighthood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> 2. The King Summons both Houſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and tells them, <hi>That he had ſtaid in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>longer than he expected, yet not fruitleſly, for he had given full ſatisfaction to that Nation; but cannot chuſe but take notice of, and wonder at, the unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſtractions he finds at home;</hi> and then commends
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66116:45"/>to them the State of <hi>Ireland:</hi> next he publiſhes a Proclamation <hi>for Obedience to the Laws, in force concerning Religion, and the performance of Divine Service without Innovation or Aboliſhing of Rites and Ceremonies. January</hi> 20, His Majeſty makes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Speech to them, and Conjures them by all that is dear to him or them, to haſten the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland.</hi> After which the Commons ordered a Select Committee to draw up a Petition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance to the King; the Petition was thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt Gracious Soveraign, your Majeſties moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and faithful Subjects the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled, do with joy acknowledge the Favour of God in your ſafe return into</hi> England, <hi>where the dangers and diſtempers of the State have cauſed them to deſire your Preſence and Authority to your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for preventing of imminent Ruin and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to your Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by a malignant party, for alteration of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Government, the increaſe of Popery by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of</hi> Jeſuites, <hi>and other Engineers and Factors of</hi> Rome, <hi>corrupting the Biſhops and Privy Council; they being the cauſe of the late</hi> Scottiſh War, <hi>and the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Rebellion: Now for prevention, they pray, That your Majeſty would concur with your Parliament to deprive the Biſhops of their Votes, To take away Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in Religion, Church Government, and Diſcipline, To purge your Councils of ſuch as are promoters of theſe Corruptions, and not alienate any Eſcheated Lands in</hi> Ireland <hi>by reaſon of the Rebellion! and theſe being granted, we will make you happy,</hi>

The Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and Fining ſeveral of the Members, raiſing great Sums of Money by Loan, Privy Seals, and Exciſe, and blaſting <hi>The Petition of Right,</hi> The ſucceſleſs Attempts upon <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and Peace made with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> without conſent of Parliament: The loſs of <hi>Rochel</hi> occaſioned by lending part of our Fleet to the <hi>French</hi> King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the cauſe of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> charging the Kingdom with Billeting Souldiers, and the Deſign
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66116:46"/>of bringing in <hi>German</hi> Horſe to inſlave this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Arbitrary Contributions: Laſtly they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon Scandalous Declarations publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament, upon Injuſtice, Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Violence, Illegal Inlargements of Forreſts, Coat, and Conduct Money, Corrupt Councils and Deſigns, Projects, Monopolies, Illegal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in Courts of Judicature, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Table; charging the Biſhops likewiſe with many Enormities, particularly for contributing to raiſe an Army for conſtraining the <hi>Scots</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to their Superſtitious Ceremonies; conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with what they have done for the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Abuſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To their Petition the King returned this Anſwer, <hi>That he knows not any Wicked or Malignant Perſons whom he doth either countenance or imploy; That he would concur with his People in a Parliamentary way againſt all</hi> Popiſh <hi>Deſigns, but would not conſent to deprive the Biſhops of their Votes in Parliament: That he judged the power of the Clergy ſufficiently moderated by taking away the High Commiſſion Court, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no further Abridgment; That he was willing to concur with them for removal of any Innovations in Religion by a National Synod; That he had no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors nor Miniſters of State whom he would not at any time expoſe to Trial, and leave to the Law, but cannot agree that any others ſhould have the choice of them but himſelf, That he concurs with them for not altering the Forfeited Lands in</hi> Ireland, <hi>but thinks it not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſolve, before the Event of War be ſeen; and doubts not of their Loyal Endeavours for the ſupport of his Royal State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to the Remonſtrance, the King Iſſues out a Declaration to his Subjects, the Sum of which was, <hi>That he thought he had given ſufficient ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66116:47"/>to his Peoples Fears and Jealonſies, concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Liberty, and Civil Intereſts, by the Bills which he had paſſed this Parliament; deſiring that miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings might be removed on either ſide, and that the bleeding Condition of</hi> Ireland <hi>might perſwade them to Unity, for the relief of that unhappy Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after happened the Inſolent Tumults of the <hi>London</hi> Apprentices, who in a riotous manner went to <hi>White-hall</hi> and <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> to the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the King; who thereupon command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord Mayor, and Common Council to keep a double Watch and Guard, for preventing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; and <hi>Dec.</hi> 28. the King ſends a Meſſage to the Lords, <hi>That he would raiſe Ten thouſand Voluntiers for</hi> Ireland, <hi>if the Commons would undertake to pay them:</hi> On New-years day a Proclamation was publiſhed againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> declaring, <hi>Thoſe that were in Arms, with all their Adherents and Abettors, to be Rebels and Traytors:</hi> Two days after, the King upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that the <hi>L.

            </p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:66116:47"/>
            <p>Hereupon the King charges the L. <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the 5 Members with ſeveral Articles, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints both Houſes, <hi>That he did intend to proſecute them for High Treaſon, and required that their Perſons might be ſecured:</hi> And the next day the King At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his Guard of Penſioners, and ſome Hundreds of Gentlemen, went to the Houſe of Commons, and the Guard ſtaying without, the King with the <hi>Palſgrave,</hi> entred the Houſe, at whoſe entrance the Speaker riſes out of the Chair, and the King ſitting down therein, Views the Houſe round, and perceives the Birds he aimed at were flown, for having warning they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn into <hi>London;</hi> whereupon he tells them, <hi>That he came to look for thoſe</hi> 5 <hi>Members whom he had accuſed of High Treaſon and was reſolved to have them where ever he found them; and expected to have them ſent to him as ſoon as they ſhould come to the Houſe; but would not have them think that this Act of his was any Violation of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Act of the Kings was ſo highly reſented by the Houſe, that the next day <hi>January</hi> 5, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Voted it a Breach of Priviledge, and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals were raiſed in the City, that he intended Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence againſt the Houſe of Commons, and came thither with force to Murther ſeveral Members, and uſed threatning Speeches againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; with which the City was ſo poſſeſſed, That unuſual Guards and Watches were ſet, as if ſome deſperate Aſſault were to be made upon the City, and the Houſes Adjourned till the Tueſday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, appointing a Committee in the mean time to ſit at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> to conſider of the moſt Effectual Means for their Security. And then they publiſh a Declaration, <hi>That whoſoever ſhall Arrest any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament by Warrant from the King only, is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66116:48"/>Guilty of the Breach of Priviledges of Parliament; and likewiſe that all thoſe who attended the King when he came to demand the</hi> 5 <hi>Members, were Guilty of a Traiterous Deſign againſt the King and Parliament, That the Proclamation for Apprehending and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Members, was Falſe, Scandalous, and Illegal, and not of Validity enough to hinder them from attending the Houſe; and that the publiſhing of the ſeveral Articles of High Treaſon was a Breach of Priviledge; wherefore they intreat his Majeſty, to diſcover the Names of thoſe Informers and Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors; declaring all ſuch Perſons to be publick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Londoners</hi> came thronging to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with Petitions, inveighing bitterly againſt ſome of the Peers, but eſpecially the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, whom they affronted as they went to the Houſe; upon which they were ſo affrighted, that Twelve Biſhops abſent themſelves from the Houſe of Lords, drawing up a Proteſtation againſt all Laws, Orders, Votes, Reſolutions, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, as in themſelves null and of none effect, which had paſſed, or ſhould paſs, during their forced Abſence; deſiring their Proteſtation might be entred by the Clerk of the Houſe of Peers. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after which, at a Conference between both Houſes, it was agreed, <hi>That this Proteſtation of the Twelve Biſhops, did extend to the deep intrenching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fundamental Priviledges and Being of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and in a ſhort time they were accuſed of High Treaſon, ſeized and brought on their knees at the Lords Bar: Ten of them were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the other two, in regard of their Age, to the Black Rod.</p>
            <p>The King at this time, thinking himſelf unſafe without a Guard, accepted of the offer of ſome
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66116:48"/>Gentlemen of the <hi>Inns of Court</hi> to be a Guard to him, which inſtead of ſecurity, was by ſubtil men made more prejudicial to the King, by taking this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to raiſe the rage and jealouſie of the City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; for at midnight there were crys made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But the Houſe of Commons, to obviate this, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuſpicion of ſome deſign upon their perſons, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the King for a Guard, to be commanded by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> of whoſe fidelity to the King and State, no queſtion was ever made. This Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was denied by the King, as not willing to have them too ſtrong, yet promiſed to take ſuch care for their ſecurity from Violence, as he would for the preſervation of Himſelf and Children; and if this general Aſſurrnce would not ſuffice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe Apprehenſions, he would command ſuch a Guard to wait upon them, as he would be reſponſible for to Almighty God.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer being unſatisfactory, the City joyn with them, and in their Common Council drew up a Petition, complaining, <hi>That the Trade of the City was decayed, to the utter Ruin of the</hi> Proteſtant Religion, <hi>and the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, by the Deſigns of</hi> Papiſts, Foreigners and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks <hi>(more particularly their fomenting the Iriſh Rebellion) by changing the Conſtable of the Tower, and

            </p>
            <p>To their Petition the King returned Anſwer <hi>That he could not expreſs a greater ſenſe of</hi> Ireland <hi>that he had done; That meerly to ſatisfie the City, he had removed a worthy Perſon from the charge of the</hi> Tower; <hi>and that the late Tumults had cauſed him to fortifie</hi> White-hall, <hi>for the ſecurity of his own Perſon, That his going to the Houſe of Commons was to apprehend thoſe five Members for Treaſon, to which the Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Parliament could not extend; and that yet he would proceed againſt them no otherwiſe than le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now ſuch numbers of ordinary People dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered about <hi>Westminſter</hi> and <hi>White-hall,</hi> that the King doubting of their Intentions, thought fit to with-draw to <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> taking with him the Queen, Prince, and Duke of <hi>York;</hi> where he and his Retinue and Guard quickly increaſed, by acceſſion of divers of the Gentry. But the next day the Five Members were triumphantly guarded to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by a great number of Citizens and Seamen, with hundreds of Boats and Barges, with Guns in them, ſhouting and hallowing as they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>White-hall,</hi> and making large Proteſtations
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66116:49"/>at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> of their conſtant fidelity and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Parliament. About this time the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had notice the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> and Collonel <hi>Lunsford</hi> were raiſing Troops of Horſe at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> where the County Magazine was lodged; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they order, <hi>That the County Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and the Trained Bands, ſhall take care to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Countreys and their Magazine, and ſuppreſs all unlawful Aſſemblies. Lunsford</hi> was ſeized and ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but <hi>Digby</hi> eſcaped beyond Sea. The King removed to <hi>Royston,</hi> at which time Sir <hi>Edward Harbert,</hi> Attorney General, is queſtioned at the Lords Bar, to anſwer concerning the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt the Five Members; where it had gone hard with him, if the King (at his earneſt Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,) had not taken him off by a Letter to the Lord Keeper <hi>Littleton</hi> (who ſucceeded L. <hi>Finch</hi>) wherein the King clears the Attorney General, and takes the whole buſineſs upon himſelf, yet concludes, <hi>That finding cauſe wholly to deſiſt from proceeding againſt the Perſons Accuſed, he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Attorney General to proceed no further there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor to produce nor diſcover any proof concerning the ſame:</hi> And ſo this Breach between the King and Parliament, ſeemed at preſent to be made up.</p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>Scots</hi> having a conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in their <hi>Britttiſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>Ireland,</hi> make Propoſals for Tranſporting 2500 Souldiers thither, which were accepted by both Houſes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſented to by the King: after which the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners interpoſed their Meditation for compoſing the differences between the King and Parliament, which were now grown to too great an height, for which Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> was ordered by the Commons to give them the thanks of the Houſe.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:66116:50"/>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 20. The King ſends a Meſſage to the Parliament, propoſing the ſecurity of his own juſt Rights and Royal Authority, and, <hi>That ſince par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grievances and Diſtractions were too many, and would be too great to be preſented by themſelves, that they would comprize and digeſt them into one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire body, and ſend them to him; and it ſhould then appear how ready he would be to equal or exceed the greatest Examples of the moſt Iudulgent Princes, in their Acts of Grace, and Favour to the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Commons move the Lords to joyn with them in Petitioning for the <hi>Militia</hi> and the Command of the <hi>Tower,</hi> but they not complying, the Houſe of Commons ſingly of themſelves Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune the King to put thoſe things into the hands of the Parliament, as the only available means for removal of their Fears and Jealouſies. But the King, not willing to part with the Principal Jewels of his Crown, ſignified to them: <hi>That he thought the</hi> Militia <hi>to be lawfully ſubject to no command but his own, and therefore would not let it out of his hands, That he had preferred to the Lieutenancy of the</hi> Tower, <hi>a Perſon of known Fortune and unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reputation, and that he would prefer none but ſuch to the command of his Forts and Castles; yet would not intrust the power of conferring thoſe Places and Dignities from himſelf; being derived to him from his Anceſtors, by the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom;</hi> Yet the Commons would not deſiſt, but again peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and were again refuſed.</p>
            <p>Soon after divers Petitions were delivered to the Parliament againſt the Votes of Popiſh Lords and Biſhops in the Houſe of Peers, as one from <hi>Suffolk</hi> with 1500, and another from the <hi>Londoners</hi> with 2000 hands, and a Third from the City Dames; All which were Anſwered, <hi>That the Commons had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66116:50"/>already endeavoured Relief from the Lords in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and ſhould ſo continue till Redreſs were obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And ſhortly after, the Lords paſſed the Bill <hi>For diſabling all Perſons in Holy Orders, to have any Place or Vote in Parliament, or to exerciſe any Temporal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction;</hi> At the ſame time they petition the King again for the <hi>Militia,</hi> and for clearing <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the Five Members, by his Anſwer to both which they underſtood his Reſolution, <hi>Not to intruſt the</hi> Militia <hi>out of himſelf, nor to clear the Members but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a General Pardon;</hi> which was unſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>The King now at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> thought fit to ſend for all his Domeſtick Servants of either Houſe of Parliament, and particularly the Earls of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> but they refuſed to come, excuſing themſelves with, <hi>The neceſſity of performing their duties in Parliament, and diſcharging the Truſt repoſed in them:</hi> For which they were put from their Places at Court.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Digby</hi> about this time ſent Three Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>Middleburg</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> (where he was fled out of <hi>England</hi>) one to the Queen, and two others to Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and Sir <hi>Lewes Dives;</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, <hi>That if the King would openly declare his mind, and betake himſelf to ſome place of ſecurity, that he might come freely to him, he doubted not but he ſhould do him ſome acceptable Service:</hi> Theſe Letters were intercepted by the Parliament, and by them after peruſal ſent to the King, with their Intreaties to him, <hi>That he would perſwade the Queen not to correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with</hi> Digby <hi>or any other whom his</hi> Great Council <hi>had proclaimed</hi> Traytors.</p>
            <p>There was a Report that the Parliament intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Accuſe the Queen of High-Treaſon, as one that had ſo much power with the King to miſadviſe him; this rumour the Parliament exuſed, as a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66116:51"/>publick Scandal upon them; which ſhe ſeemed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with, yet provides againſt the danger, and therefore prevails with the King to accompany her Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with her all the Kings and her own Jewels, together with thoſe entailed upon the Crown; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with thoſe, and ſome other Aſſiſtance, to raiſe a Party ſufficient to maintain the King and his Regalities againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> at a Conferrence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the General Flocking of Papiſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> affirmed, <hi>That ſince the Lieutenant had ordered a ſtop upon the Ports againſt all</hi> Iriſh <hi>Papiſts, many of the Chief Commanders, now in the head of the Rebels, had been licenſed to paſs thither by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties immediate Warrant.</hi> The King was highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this Speech, which he ſignified to the Houſe, who in their Anſwer to his Meſſage, juſtifie Mr. <hi>Pym</hi>'s words to be the ſenſe of the Houſe, and, <hi>That they had yet in ſafe Ouſtody the Lord</hi> Delvin, <hi>Sir</hi> George Hamilton, <hi>Colonel</hi> Butler, Brother to the Lord <hi>Miniard,</hi> now in Rebellion, and one of the Lord <hi>Nettervils</hi> Sons: To which the King replies, <hi>That he thought Mr.</hi> Pym<hi>'s Speech was not ſo well grounded as it ought to have been, and that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned perſons had their Paſſes granted before he knew of the Parliaments Order of Restraint; and therefore expected their Declaration for his Vindication from thut odious calumny of conniving, or underhand favouring that abhorred Iriſh Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this His Majeſties deſire proved fruitleſs, for they next moved the King to turn out Sir <hi>John By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> out of the Lieutenancy of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and at their Nomination Sir <hi>John Conyers</hi> ſucceeded; they then proceeded to name fit Perſons for truſt of the <hi>Militia</hi> in the ſeveral Counties, and by Act of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66116:51"/>Parliament <hi>Diſabled all Clergy-men from exerciſing Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Juriſdiction:</hi> After which the King by a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage offers them, <hi>To require by Proclamation all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes concerning</hi> Popiſh <hi>Recuſants to be put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That the ſeven Condemned Popiſh Prieſts ſhall be Baniſhed, and all Romiſh Prieſts within twenty days ſhall depart the Kingdom; That he refers the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church Government and Liturgy wholly to the Houſes, and offers to go himſelf in Perſon against the Rebels in</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>But the Commons were now buſie about a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Vindicating their Five Members, wherein they deſire the King to ſend them the Informers againſt the ſaid Members, or otherwiſe to deſert their Proſecution would not ſuffice; becauſe the whole Parliament was concerned in the Charge. And then they proceeded to ſettle the <hi>Militia</hi> for the defence of the Parliament, Tower, and City of <hi>London,</hi> under the Command of Serjeant Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Skippon,</hi> who had formerly been an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Souldier in the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> The King had deferred his Anſwer to their Petition for ſettling the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Counties, according to their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, till his return from <hi>Dover,</hi> where he took leave of his Wife and Daughter, and ſo returned to <hi>Greenwich;</hi> from whence he ſent to <hi>Hampton Court</hi> for his two Eldeſt Sons to come to him, though contrary to the mind of the Parliament, who would have diſſwaded him from it.</p>
            <p>And now the Parliament thought fit to conſider of the reducing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ordered two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and an half of thoſe Acres to be Confiſcate, of Rebels Lands in Four Provinces, ſhall be allotted to ſuch Perſons as will disburſe Money for carrying on that War, and ſeveral other Proviſions were made for their Security, which the King confirms
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66116:52"/>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. 1641; and in purſuance thereof a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sum of Money was raiſed, the People being generally free in their Contributions.</p>
            <p>The King being now at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> ſends this Anſwer to the Petition about the <hi>Militia, That he is willing to condeſcend to all the Propoſals concerning the</hi> Militia <hi>of the Counties, and the Perſons mentioned, but not of</hi> London, <hi>and other Corporations, whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in that particular, he thought it neither Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice nor Policy to alter; but would not conſent to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest himſelf of the Power of the County</hi> Militia <hi>for an indefinite time, but for ſome limited ſpace,</hi> This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer did not ſatisfie, ſo that the Breach growing daily wider, the King declined theſe parts and the Parliament, and removed to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> taking with him, the Prince, and the D. of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>March</hi> he receives a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition from the Parliament, wherein they require the <hi>Militia</hi> more reſolutely than before, affirming, <hi>Than in caſe of denial, the imminent dangers would conſtrain them to diſpoſe of it by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; deſiring alſo that he would make his abode near</hi> London <hi>and the Parliament, and continue the Prince at ſome of his Houſes near the City, for the better car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of Affairs and preventing the Peoples Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Fears;</hi> All which being refuſed, They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Order, <hi>That the Kingdom be put into a poſture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:66116:52"/>
            <p>And now began our Troubles, and all the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a Civil War; the Parliament every day entertaining (or pretending to entertain) new Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and Suſpicions of the Kings Actions, which howſoever in complement, they made ſhew of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting only to his Evil Council, yet obliquely had had too great a Reflection upon his Perſon. They now proceed on a ſudden to make great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both by Sea and Land; and the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> is commanded to rig the Kings Ships and fit them for Sea; and likwiſe all Maſters and Owners of Ships were perſwaded to do the like. The Beacons were repaired, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks ſet up, and extraordinary poſting up and down with Pacquets; all ſad Prognoſticks of the Calamities enſuing.</p>
            <p>The King being now at <hi>Royſion, March</hi> 9, the Earls of <hi>Pembrook</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> bring him the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Declaration, and read it to him; wherein they repreſent to him ſome former miſcarriages: <hi>As the attempts to incenſe the late</hi> Nor hern <hi>Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament. The</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Troubles, L.</hi> Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins <hi>Treaſons and Tranſportation by the Kings War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. The Petition delivered to Captain</hi> Leg, <hi>with the Kings own hand, with the Direction ſigned</hi> C. R. <hi>The buſineſs of the Lord</hi> Kimbolton <hi>and the five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The ſuſpicious deſigning a Guard about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and under hand promoting the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Rebellion. The ordering Sir</hi> John Pennington <hi>to land the Lord</hi> Digby <hi>beyond Sea; from thence to alienate the King from his Parliament, and to procure Forreign Forces for his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistance; which now (ſaid they) appeared more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible by reaſon of his removal with the Prince, and the manifold Advertiſements from</hi> Rome, Venice, Paris, <hi>and other parts, certifying that the Popes</hi> Nuncio <hi>had ſollicited the Kings of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>to lend his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66116:53"/>Majeſty</hi> 4000 <hi>Men apeice in reference to ſome Deſign againſt Religion and the Parliament, and lastly, They deſire him to turn away his wicked Councellors, and to rely upon his Parliament, which if he would do, they would ſacrifice their Lives, Fortunes, and utmoſt endeavours to the Supportation of his Soveraignty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the reading of the Declaration, the Lords would have perſwaded the King to come near the the Parliament, and to grant the <hi>Militia</hi> for a time; which his Majeſty refuſed, and told them in ſhort, <hi>That their Fears, and Doubts and Jealouſies were ſuch as he would take time to ſatisfy the whole World of; but that his own doubts were not Trivial, occaſioned by ſo many Scandalous Pamphlets, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Sermons; divers publick Tumults hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inquired into, and unpuniſhed;</hi> and ſometime after the King publiſhed a Declaration to the People, in Anſwer to theirs; the ſum of which was.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That he had no evil Councellors about him, but leaves ſuch to their cenſure where they ſhould find them. That he deſired the Judgments of Heaven might be manifeſted upon thoſe who had any deſign againſt the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion. That the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Troubles were buried in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſilence, by the <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> and paſſed in Parliaments of both Kingdoms. That they charging him with any inclining to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, was a high and cauſleſs injury to his Royal Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. That he never intended to exaſperate the late Army, or in any wiſe to uſe them againſt the Parliament. That Captain <hi>Leg's</hi> Petition was brought to him, ſubſcribed by the Officers of the Army, deſiring that the Parliament might not be hindred from reforming the Church and State, to the Model of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days; and was advantageous to them: And to aſſure Sir <hi>Jacob
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66116:53"/>Aſhly</hi> of his Opinion therein, he writ <hi>C. R.</hi> That the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jermin,</hi> neither were at <hi>White-hall,</hi> nor had any Warrant from him after the Reſtraint. That he had given ſufficient Anſwer about <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the five Members. That the care of his own ſafety cauſed him to raiſe a Guard at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and to receive the Loyal Tender, which the Gentlemen of the <hi>Inns of Court</hi> did make him of their Service. And that he looked upon their Forreign Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by them mentioned, as meerly wild and irrational.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King goes further <hi>Northward,</hi> whilſt the Parliament Voted the Ordinance for Defence of the Kingdom, not to be prejudicial to the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> but to be obeyed as the Fundamental Laws; and that the Kings Commands for Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy over the ſeveral Counties were illegal and void; but he coming to <hi>Huntington</hi> ſends them a Meſſage, <hi>March</hi> 15. <hi>That he intends to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at</hi> York, <hi>and deſires them to hasten their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours for</hi> Ireland, <hi>and not upon any pretence of Order or Ordinance (to which he is not a Party) of the</hi> Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, <hi>or any other thing, to Do or Execute against the Laws, which he himſelf was to keep, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey, declaring his Subjects not to be obliged to obey any Act, Order, or Injunction to which he hath not given conſent:</hi> In anſwer to which, they reſolve <hi>That the abſence of the King ſo far from his Parliament; was deſtructive to the Relief of</hi> Ireland; <hi>and therefore all thoſe Councellors which adviſed him to it, are to be ſuſpected as Favourers of that bloody Rebellion, as likewiſe thoſe who perſwaded his Majeſty to queſtion or contradict their Votes, which was a high breach of Priviledge of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 16. The King at <hi>Stamford</hi> publiſhed a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66116:54"/>Proclamation for putting the Laws in Execution againſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> Recuſants; and from thence he goes to <hi>York,</hi> and there <hi>March</hi> 24, Repeals his Grant for paſſing the <hi>Bill against Tonnage and Poundage,</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 22 laſt paſt, commanding the payment thereof for the future, according to the Act of the Firſt of King <hi>James;</hi> and ſo this year ended.</p>
            <p>It was now the year 1642, and the 18th of his Majeſties Reign, when a freſh Difference aroſe; for the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> being indiſpoſed, the King ordered Sir <hi>John Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington,</hi> Vice Admiral, to take the charge of the Summer Fleet for the Narrow Seas; but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament earneſtly deſired that it might be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> but were refuſed by the King to their great diſtaſte. During the Aſſizes at <hi>York,</hi> the Gentry, Miniſters, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of that County, preſented a Petition to the King, to endeavour an Agreement with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who adviſes them to apply themſelves to the Parliament, for the good of all. And next day he ſends a Meſſage to the Houſes, <q>That he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to raiſe his Guard out of the Counties near <hi>Chester,</hi> Two thouſand Foot and Two hundred Horſe, to be ſupplied with Arms from the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine at <hi>Hull,</hi> upon taking the Oaths of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Allegiance, That if the Parliaments Undertaking for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, would not ſuffice to defray the Charges of raiſing and paying them, he would pawn or ſell his Land or Houſes; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them withal, to quicken their Levies for <hi>Munster,</hi> and <hi>Connaught,</hi> as the <hi>Scots</hi> already did theirs of <hi>Ulſter;</hi> and offers his Perſon againſt the Rebels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament having for ſome time miſtruſted the Kings going <hi>North,</hi> to be intended for ſeizing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66116:54"/>the Magazine at <hi>Hull,</hi> endeavoured to prevent it, declaring their ſuſpicion of his deſign to raiſe an Army, and therefore pray, <q>That it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as a place of more ſafety, and eaſier tranſport for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and that the Repreive for the popiſh prieſts in <hi>Newgate</hi> may be recalled and they executed.</q> And to make all ſure, Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Houſe of Commons, is ſent down to take upon him the Government of that place, who by his ſudden coming thither, prevented the Earl of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> who was deſigned by the King to be Governor thereof; ſo that when the King came to <hi>Hull</hi> in Perſon, with his Guard conſiſting of Lords and Gentlemen, <hi>April</hi> 23. 1642, he finds the Gates ſhut upon him, and the Bridges drawn up; but from the Wall <hi>Hotham</hi> appears, and upon his knees intreats his Majeſty, <hi>Not to command that, which, without the breach of his Truſt, he could not yeild obedience to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the King finding his entrance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, cauſed <hi>Hotham</hi> inſtantly to be proclaimed Traytor; and by Letters to the Parliament, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of that Indignity, and required ſatisfaction; but they juſtified him therein, and ſent a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the Lords and Commons to reſide there, for the better ſecuring the Garriſon to them, and gave the Governor power to raiſe the Trained Bands for his defence; after which the King hearing that the Parliament had raiſed a Guard of themſelves without his conſent; and reflecting upon the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of <hi>Hotham,</hi> he ſummoned the Gentry of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> to a Meeting, and acquainted them, <q>That his Magazine at <hi>Hull</hi> was going to be taken from him againſt his will, the <hi>Militia</hi> againſt the Law and his conſent, put in execution, and Sir
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66116:55"/>
                  <hi>John Hothams</hi> Treaſon countenanced, ſo that he was reſolved to have a Guard to ſecure his perſon, in which he deſired their aſſiſtance, that he might be able to protect them, the Laws, and the true Proteſtant Religion, from violation or injury.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King had hereby indifferently ſtrengthened himſelf, and more had come in had not thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, who came to the King at <hi>York,</hi> prevailed with ſome of the Free-holders to proteſt againſt it. And the Parliament declare, <q>That the Subjects unleſs bound to it by ſpecial Service, could not be commanded to attend the King at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without tranſgreſſing againſt the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom. And that whoſoever, upon pretence of his Majeſties Command, ſhall take up Arms in a warlike manner, ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed diſturbers of the peace, and to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt accordingly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while Sir <hi>Thomas Gardiner,</hi> who had been Recorder of <hi>London</hi> for ſix years, being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached by the Parliament, and in danger of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was glad to ſhift for himſelf, and by flight eſcaped to the King; at which time his Majeſty endeavoured to have removed the Term from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> but was much oppoſed therein by the Parliament, who Voted it Illegal, and forbid the L. Keeper to iſſue out Writs, or Seal any Proclamation to that purpoſe. The Parliament now proceed to put the people into a Military poſture, requiring all Perſons in Authority to put the late Ordinance of the <hi>Militia</hi> in Execution, which the King by his Proclamation forbids; but for the Peoples ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the Parliament publiſh'd a ſevere Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſame Effect as their former Remonſtrance; only this was added, <q>That the King at his being in <hi>Scotland</hi> had countenanced the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66116:55"/>Deſigns, and that his connivance was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by his tedious with-holding the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby they were declared Traytors, till <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. being almoſt a Quarter of a Year after the breaking out of the Rebellion, and then had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed but forty Copies to be printed, &amp; none of them to be publiſhed without his pleaſure ſignified; whereas his Proclamations againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> had been diſperſed throughout all the Kingdom with publick Prayers and Execrations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King makes a ſpeedy Anſwer hereunto, not much differing from what he had ſaid before; yet tells them, <q>That as to the buſineſs of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> his Council in <hi>Ireland</hi> had deſired them no ſooner, nor ſo many Copies by twenty as he had Signed and and ſent them. His Majeſty had written a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Privy Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to take away from them all ſuſpicion of thoſe Imputations ſo frequently laid to his Charge, of being <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, to be guilty of the bloodſhed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to bring in Forreign Forces;</q> Wherewith they ſeemed ſo ſatisfied, that they returned a moſt reſpectful Anſwer, and preſently interpoſed their Mediation to heal the Breach before it grew wider; humbly deſiring the King <hi>to hearken to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as his greateſt, his beſt, and moſt unparallel'd Council; and diſcouraging him from any perſonal Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into</hi> Ireland. This Meſſage was ſent by the Earl of <hi>Lowden,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and after this the <hi>Scots</hi> Petition to the Kings Privy Council there, <hi>Not to meddle with any verbal or real Engagement for the King againſt the Parliament.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament publiſh a Proteſtation, wherein they vindicate their own proceedings, and declare the great ſenſe they had of the Affection of their <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Brethren, manifeſted unto them in ſo many
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66116:56"/>particulars, and more eſpecially the mentioned Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> an Old Experienced Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, prudently foreſaw that ſuch unhappy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings muſt neceſſarily have a very bad Iſſue, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly endeavoured an Accommodation by ſtating the Caſe in the Houſe of Lords; repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Offers of the King on the one ſide, and the Profeſſions of the Parliament on the other; and likewiſe the dreadful Effects of a Civil War (then likely to enſue) by the Example of the woful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the expenſive Troubles in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and then propoſes ſome methods for preventing theſe dangers: as <q>1. That a ſelect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Parliament ſhould truly ſtate the matters in difference, with the moſt probable ways of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling them. 2. To conſider particularly what may be expected, either in point of ſupporting the King, or releiving his People: And laſtly, how the Conditions agreed upon, may be ſecured. And to ſhew the neceſſity of this courſe, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the deplorable State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the debts and neceſſities of the Crown, the diſtractions which were likely to produce confuſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, moſt dangerous and deſtructive to a State, beſides the general Diſtraction of the Subjects, who between Commands, and Countermands, knew not whom to obey,</q> This was admitted as good and ſolid Reaſon, but Divine Juſtice would not ſo permit the Sins of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation to go unpuniſhed, and the L. <hi>Briſtols</hi> Speech, though well received, yet proved ineffectual.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Kings Guard increaſes at <hi>York,</hi> which the Houſe Voted a preparation for War againſt the Parliament, a Breach of the Truſt repoſed in him by his People, and that all ſuch as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66116:56"/>ſerve him there are Traitors to the Laws of the Kingdom, as the 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and the 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. This was followed by another Declaration or Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the miſactions of the King, and their own Priviledges, which the King anſwers and they again reply to; and <hi>May</hi> 28. the Parliament or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, That all Sheriffs, Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make ſtay of all Arms and Ammunition going to the King at <hi>York;</hi> the King on the other ſide forbids all Perſons belonging to the Trained Bands or <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, to obey any Order, or Ordinance of any of the Houſes; divers Members of both Houſes withdrew themſelves to the King, as being unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with their proceedings; whereupon the Parliament Ordered, That all ſuch as did not make their Perſonal Appearance by <hi>June</hi> 16 enſuing, ſhould be fined an 100 pounds toward the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wars, ſuch only excepted as were imployed by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe underſtood that the Queen had pawned the Crown Jewels in <hi>Holland</hi> for Money to be tranſported to the King; which to prevent him of, they order, <hi>That whoever hath; or ſhall pay, lend, ſend, or bring any Money in</hi> Specie <hi>into this Kingdom, for, or upon thoſe Jewels; or accept of any Bill hereafter, ſhall be an Enemy to the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 2. The Parliament ſent to the King Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Propoſition: <q>1. That all the Kings Privy Council, great Officers, and Miniſters of State, may be put out, except ſuch as the Parliament ſhall approve; and that an Oath be tendered them. 2. That all Affairs of State be managed by the Parliament, except ſuch matters as are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd by them to the Privy Council, and to be concluded by the major part of the Nobility under their hands, the full number not to exceed twenty
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66116:57"/>five, nor to be under Fifteen. If any place ſhall fall Void in the interval of Parliament, then that the major part of the Council chuſe one to be confirmed at the next Seſſion of Parliament, 3. That all great Officers of the Kingdom, ſhall be choſen with Approbation of Parliament. 4. That the Government and Education of the Kings Children, be by appointment of Parliament. 5. That their Marriages be treated and concluded by Parliament. 6. That the Laws againſt <hi>Papiſts, Prieſts,</hi> and others, be executed, without To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration or Diſpenſation, except by Parliament. 7. That no <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lord or Peer have Vote in Parliament; and their Children be educated in the <hi>Protestant Faith.</hi> 8. That Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be reformed as the Parliament ſhall adviſe. 9. That the <hi>Militia</hi> be ſettled as the Parliament have ordered, and that the King recall all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, publiſhed againſt their Ordinances therein. 10. That all Privy Councellors and Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges take an Oath for the maintenance of <hi>The Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right,</hi> and other Statutes, which ſhall be made this Parliament. 11. That all Officers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Parliament hold their places, <hi>Quam diu bene ſegeſſerint,</hi> as long as they ſhall act juſtly. 12. That all Members of Parliament put out, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time, be reſtored again. 13. That the Juſtice of Parliament paſs upon all Delinquents, and that they appear or abide their cenſure. 14. That the general Pardon paſs with Exceptions, as the Parliament ſhall adviſe. 15. That all Forts and Caſtles of this Kingdom be diſpoſed of by Parliament. 16. That the King diſcharge all his Guards and Forces now in being, and not raiſe any other, but in caſe of actual Rebellion. 17. That the King enter into ſtrict Alliance with all <hi>Protestant</hi> Kingdoms and States for their Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66116:57"/>to recover the Rights of his Siſter, and her Princely Iſſue, to thoſe Dignities and Dominions which belong to them: 18. That the Lord <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolton</hi> and the Five Members be cleared by <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> 19. That no Peer hereafter to be made, ſhall ſit in Parliament without their conſent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe propoſitions were rejected by the King, as inconſiſtent with his Regality: ſo that now Men began to diſpair of any good iſſue, for both ſides make preparations for War: The King ſending out his <hi>Commiſſions of Array;</hi> and the Parliament publiſhed an Order <hi>June</hi> 10. for bringing in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or plate to maintain the Horſe, Horſe-men, and Arms, for the publick peace and defence of the King and both Houſes of Parliament; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Kings <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to be againſt the Law, Liberty and property of the Subject; and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors therein to be diſturbers of the peace, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the Subjects Liberty. At this time the Lord keeper <hi>Littleton,</hi> having delivered the Great Seal to one <hi>Eliot,</hi> whom the King ſent for it, durſt not ſtay behind for fear of being queſtioned, but went to the King to <hi>York,</hi> as many of the Peers did likewiſe whom the King ſummoning together, as alſo his Privy Council, he declares and proteſts to them, <q>That he would not Uſurp any Illegal Authority over them, but is ready to maintain them againſt all others that would. And that he would defend them from all Votes and Orders of Parliament, together with the true <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, the lawful Liberty of the Subject, and the juſt Priviledges of the Three Eſtates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor will he Engage them in any War but what ſhall be for the neceſſary defence of his and their rights;</q> Whereupon they all ingaged to him their Duty and Allegiance in a moſt Solemn-Proteſtation,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66116:58"/>After which the King ſent Letters to Sir <hi>Rich. Gurney</hi> L.

            <p>At this time the King publiſheth a General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, wherein he deſcants upon all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Declarations for the laſt 7 Months, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the laſt; profeſſing that hence forward he expects they ſhould break out into diſloyal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, declaims againſt their making the defence of the King, to be the pretence for their raiſing Forces; proteſts his own conſtant Reſolution for the preſerving of Peace, Religion, the Laws and Subjects Liberties, and expects all his Subjects to aſſiſt him againſt the Traiterous Attempts of ſuch Men as would deſtroy his Perſon, Honour, and Eſtate, and bring on a Civil War; engaging that whoſoever ſhall bring to him Money, Ammunition, Horſe, or Arms, ſhall receive Eight Pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> Conſideration, and have good Aſſurance of both Principal and Intereſt, upon his Forreſt Lands, Parks, and Houſes.</p>
            <p>After this the King by Proclamation forbids all Levies of Forces, and all Contributions to ſuch Levies, without his expreſs pleaſure; grounding it upon ſeveral Statutes as 7 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. And then minds them of their Oath of Allegiance, by which they were bound to be Faithful, not to the King only as King, but to his Perſon, as King <hi>Charles,</hi> contrary to the Parliaments diſtinction, betwixt his Perſon and his Authority; his Perſon at <hi>York,</hi> and his Authority in Parliament; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66116:58"/>with juſtifying his <hi>Commiſſion of Array,</hi> which were now Iſſued out in ſeveral Counties in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> to this the Parliament reply, and the King again to them, which was followed by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meſſages to and fro; all which rather exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated than allayed the difference; and now began <hi>England</hi> to be divided, as <hi>Italy</hi> once was into <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gibbellines,</hi> ſo they into <hi>Rovallists</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or <hi>Cavaleers</hi> and <hi>Roundheads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the King makes a Progreſs from <hi>York</hi> into the Counties of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and Summons the Gentlemen and Freeholders to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark,</hi> he Careſſes them with the moſt obliging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions imaginable. And <hi>July</hi> 11, 1642, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſends a Meſſage to the Parliament to Certifie them of his Intentions to reduce <hi>Hull</hi> by force, if not forthwith delivered to him, which if they ſhould do, he would then admit of their future Addreſſes, and return ſuch Propoſitions as might beſt conduce to prevent the approaching War; together with this Meſſage he ſent them likewiſe a Copy of the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which he had publiſh'd againſt Sir <hi>J. Hotham,</hi> wherein he complains of the Affront done to his Perſon by Sir <hi>J.</hi> and of the Parl. juſtifying that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their Votes and Orders; That <hi>Hotham</hi> having fortified the Town, and drown'd the Countrey, had alſo ſet out a Pinnace at Sea, which had intercepted his Pacquet Boat with the Queens Letters, and that the E. of <hi>Warwick</hi> contrary to the Kings Command, had taken upon him the Command of the Fleet; for which Reaſons the King was reſolv'd to puniſh <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham.</hi> Indeed the E. of <hi>W.</hi> had been by the Parl. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the King as the fitteſt man for Admiral (the E. of <hi>N.</hi> being then ſick) but he was rejected by the King, who conferr'd that place upon Sir <hi>John Pennington;</hi> Yet afterwards the Parl. conceiving it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66116:59"/>neceſſary to get the Fleet into their hands, they found means, notwithſtanding the Oppoſitions of Sir <hi>J. Pennington</hi> and his Adherents, to make the E. of <hi>W.</hi> Admiral; after which a Ship laden with Arms and Ammunition from <hi>Holland</hi> for the King, being ignorant of the matter, fell in among the Fleet, and was by the E. of <hi>W.</hi> ſent to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Parliament now thought fit to Arm, and therefore reſolve that an Army ſhall be raiſed for Defence (as they term it) of King and Parliament; and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to be Capt.

            <p>The King was likewiſe furniſhed with Money from the Queen upon the pawned Jewels, and ſome Contributions from divers Lords and Gentlemen, and the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi> The King goes from <hi>Beverly</hi> to <hi>Leicester,</hi> and there Proclaims the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> Traitor, for removing the County <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine</hi> from the Town to his own Houſe at <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.

            </p>
            <p>This Petition was never delivered, though <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſent twice to the King for ſafe conduct for thoſe who were to preſent it; for the King refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Addreſs from thoſe whom he accuſed of High Treaſon, of whom the E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was one: The King then marches from <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> toward <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> upon which the Parliament ordered the Forces of the Aſſociated Counties of <hi>Eſſex, Hartford, Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>

This Battell of <hi>Edge-hill</hi> was fought on Sunday, the ſame day twelve Month the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion brake out.</p>
            <p>The King then takes in <hi>Banbury,</hi> the Town and Caſtle being ſurrendred without a blow, and two Regiments of Foot, and a Troop of Horſe, took Arms under him; from thence the King marches to <hi>Oxford;</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> goes to <hi>London,</hi> where he was received with great Honour; The Parliament to

            <p>At this time a Letter from one of the Kings Agents

            <p>This made way for a Treaty of Peace, but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was done in it till <hi>March</hi> 4. 1642. when Sir <hi>Ben. Rudyard</hi> one of the Commons, told the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament plainly, <hi>That the War would ruine all;</hi> whereupon they appointed Commiſſioners, that is, the E. of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perpoints,</hi> Sir. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Ermine,</hi> Sir <hi>John Holland,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> who were to attend the King at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. 1642. The Queen landed at <hi>Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Key,</hi> with Officers, Ammunition and Mony from <hi>Holland,</hi> from whence the E. of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> conveyed her to <hi>York,</hi> where ſhe was honourably received by the Earls of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and there ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to form her Army. In the mean time Coll. <hi>Maſſey</hi> advances againſt Capt. <hi>Bridges,</hi> who kept <hi>Sudly Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> with 60 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and all other things ſufficient, for the L. <hi>Shandois</hi> on the Kings behalf; Coll. <hi>Maſſy</hi> offers to ſtorm the Caſtle, but is repulſed, yet next day he poſſeſſed the Garden under the Caſtle, and firing ſome hay and ſtraw, made ſo great
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66116:63"/>a ſmother in the Houſe, that taking the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity thereof, he planted his great Guns ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently as forced the Beſieged to ſurrender upon Quarter, leaving their Arms, and ingaging to pay 500 pounds in ſix days for the goods in the Caſtle, or elſe to loſe them.</p>
            <p>Yet had the Parliament no great cauſe of boaſting of this Victory; For ſoon after <hi>P. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi> with 4000 Horſe and Foot, making ſhew to regain it, marches to <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> where the ſtrength and great part of the Magazine of the County lay, and <hi>Feb.</hi> 1. he maſters the Gaurd, and forces his Paſſage into the Town, which in two hours he gained, taking 1100 Priſoners, and 2000 Arms; And next day he ſummons <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> which Coll. <hi>Maſſey</hi> was reſolved to defend, and to ſtrengthen it, deſerts <hi>Sudly Caſtle</hi> and other our Garriſons.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and his ſon the L. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> had now raiſed an Army of near 1500 <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> for the King, with whom he marched to the Forreſt of <hi>Dean,</hi> and beat Coll. <hi>Bourroughs</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of a ſmall Town call'd <hi>Coford</hi> near <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth;</hi> from thence they march to <hi>Hingham</hi> within 2 miles of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and Coll. <hi>Bret,</hi> demands the Town for the King, but was anſwered with ſcorn; for <hi>Maſſey</hi> with aſſiſtance from Capt. <hi>Fines</hi> at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> weakned them with continual Shirmiſhes, till Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> having taking <hi>Malmsbury</hi> came to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and joyned his Forces with the other, ſo that this <hi>Welch</hi> Army ſpent near five weeks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any Memorable Action.</p>
            <p>But now Coll. <hi>Maſſey</hi> draws out all his Horſe, with 500 Foot, and ſome Ordnance, and held them play the firſt day; the next morning the great. Guns give the Alarum, and both Parties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66116:64"/>very fiercely, and the <hi>Welch</hi> were like to have routed him, and taken his Ordnance, at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> comes in to <hi>Maſſeys</hi> aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, who taking courage thereby they run fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly upon the <hi>Welchmen,</hi> and drive them back to <hi>Hingham</hi> houſe, which they began preſently to batter with their Cannon; whereupon the <hi>Welch</hi> found a Parley, and ſurrender the Place, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Priſoners, but the Officers were to receive Quarter according to their Qualities; and next day <hi>Waller</hi> and <hi>Maſſey</hi> led their booty in Triumph to <hi>Gloceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The aſſiſtance of the <hi>Scots</hi> had been formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by the Parliament, which (notwithſtanding their late Proteſtations not to take Arms againſt their Prince,) they now hearken to, and having compleated their Army, <hi>March</hi> 13. 1641. they croſs the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> and march <hi>Southward,</hi> to imploy the E. of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels about this time (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the defeats they met with at <hi>Tredagh</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk</hi>) were much increaſed in number; And the the Pope (a more unhappy Fiſher, than his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Predeceſſor St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was for ſaving, but he for deſtroying men) ſends two Letters to them, one ſubſcribed to <hi>Owen Oneal,</hi> and the other to all Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Nobles and People of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in both which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends thoſe who had already appeared in the Quarrel, and exhorts others to engage in the ſame, declaring his great Joy for their late Butcheries, and Maſſacres upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and beſtowing upon them his Fatherly Benediction, and Plenary Pardon and Abſolution for whatever Villanies they had committed. By the Popes thus publickly declaring himſelf for them, the Rebels grew very powerful,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66116:64"/>and many who were at firſt afraid of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, now openly appeared for them, inſomuch that all parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> were overwhelmed by them as with an Innundation.</p>
            <p>This year was remarkable for the death of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Richlieu</hi> that great Firebrand and diſturber of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> but more pertcularly theſe three Kingdoms, of whoſe diſtractions he was both a Principal cauſer, and Fomenter; He led the way to his Maſter <hi>Lewis</hi> 13. who deceaſed ſoon after in the midſt of his Conqueſts in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> leaving for his ſucceſſer his eldeſt ſon <hi>Lewis</hi> 14. (the preſent <hi>French</hi> King) under the Government of the Queen Dowager, and Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſucceeded in <hi>Richlieus</hi> ſtead.</p>
            <p>The year 1643. and the nineteenth of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Reign, began with a Treaty of Peace, which was formerly agreed on, but proceeded ſlowly, till it was again revived by Sir <hi>Ben. Rudyard;</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners on both parties now met at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and began to Treat of the Kings Propoſitions, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Revenue, Magazines, Forts, and Ships; And the Parliaments Propoſitions concerning the diſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Armies, which particulars taking up more time than the King expected, his Majeſty <hi>April</hi> 12. 1643. ſends this Meſſage to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That as ſoon as he was ſatisfied concerning his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, Magazines, Ships and Forces, in which he deſired nothing but his Juſt and Legal known Rights to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to him, and to Perſons Truſted by him; And as ſoon as the Members of both Houſes ſhould be reſtored to the ſame capacity of ſitting and Voting in Parliament as they had upon</hi> January 1. 1641. <hi>(excluding ſuch whoſe Votes had been taken away by Bill, or by New Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or New Writts:) And that as ſoon as his Majeſty and both Houſes may be ſecured from ſuch Tumultuous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies as to the High diſhonour of the Parliament had
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66116:65"/>awed the Members of the ſame</hi> (<hi>which he conceived could not otherwiſe be done, but by adjourning the Parliament to ſome place Twenty miles from</hi> London, <hi>ſuch as the Houſes ſhould agree upon,</hi>) <hi>His Majeſty moſt chearfully and readily would conſent to the disbanding of the Armies, and would return ſpeedily to his Two Houſes of Parliament according to the Time and Place which they ſhould agree upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Meſſage the Parliament reſolved to call back their Commiſſioners, and ſo <hi>April</hi> 15. the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ended; About the beginning of laſt <hi>March</hi> the L. <hi>Brook</hi> marched toward <hi>Northampton,</hi> and ſeizing the Ammunition there he went from thence to <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> and beat Coll. <hi>Crockers,</hi> and Lt. Coll <hi>Wagſtaff</hi>'s Forces out of that Town; after which Beſiegeing <hi>Litchfield,</hi> one of the Kings Party ſhooting at a venture at the window of his Chamber, the bullet pierced him in the Eye, of which he immediately dyed, yet his Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heightned with Revenge, took the Cloſe with the E. of <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> and all his Souldiers and Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; after which Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> joining their Forces, fell upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians at <hi>Lichfield,</hi> where the E. of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was ſlain in the head of his Troop, yet Lieut. Coll. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> who commanded it, deſpairing of ſuccour, yielded up the Place to Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> upon Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conditions, and marched away to <hi>Coventry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 17. 1643. the E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſate down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Reading,</hi> and made two aſſaults, but was repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; The King marched from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Wallingford</hi> for its relief, but <hi>Eſſexes</hi> Army increaſing daily with freſh ſupplies from <hi>London,</hi> both Parties happened to Skirmiſh at <hi>Cauſum Bridge,</hi> where many of the Kings Forces were ſlain, and forced to retreat; whereupon the Town was a while after ſurrendred
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66116:65"/>by Coll. <hi>Fielding,</hi> who was made Deputy Governour in the room of Sir <hi>Arthur Aſton</hi> who was diſabled by a bruiſe he received in his head with a Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: <hi>Fielding</hi> was for this Sentenced by a Council of War at <hi>Oxford</hi> to loſe his Head, but by the Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Friends was pardoned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 3. <hi>Cheapſide</hi> Croſs was demoliſhed a Troop of Horſe, and two Companies of Foot waiting to ſee it done, and at the fall of the Top Croſs, Drums beat, Trumpets blew, and a great ſhout was made; <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> and all other Croſſes in and about <hi>London</hi> were likewiſe pulled down about the ſame time.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the breach between the King and Parliament became wider than ever; ſo that they proceeded to draw up Articles of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the Queen, ſome of which were; <hi>That ſhe had pawned the Crown Jewells in</hi> Holland, <hi>That ſhe had favoured the the Rebellion in</hi> Ireland, <hi>That ſhe had endeavoured to raiſe a Party in</hi> Scotland <hi>againſt the Parliament, and that ſhe had gone in the head of a Popiſh Army in</hi> England; Several other Articles were framed againſt her, upon which Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> carried up an Impeachment to the Lords, who ſeemed at firſt ſurprized therewith, but they afterward agreed to the Charge.</p>
            <p>The Queen had about this time raiſed an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Army of Horſe and Foot, and leaving ſome Horſe and Foot with Sir <hi>Charles Cavendiſh</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Nottingham-ſhire,</hi> ſhe with 3000 foot, three Companies of Horſe and Foot, ſix Canons, and two Mortar pieces, met the King at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> and goes from thence with him to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several Encounters happened in the Weſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> for the King, and Sir <hi>G.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66116:66"/>Chudleigh</hi> then Commander of the Parliaments For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where ſometimes one Party was Victorious, and then the other; Collonel <hi>Nath. Fines</hi> Governout of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> about this time diſcover'd a deſign of <hi>Robert Yeomans,</hi> and <hi>George Bouchier</hi> to deliver up that City to the Kings Forces, upon which they were Condemned by Council of War, and hanged <hi>May</hi> 30 notwithſtanding the Kings Letter to the Maior and Citizens, and General <hi>Ruthens</hi> to the Governour on their behalf; And ſo ends this month, famous by the Death of Mr. <hi>John Pym</hi> that active Perſon in the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1643. Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Commons, Mr. <hi>Tomkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Challoner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Haſel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blinkhorn,</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> and others, were Arraigned at <hi>Guild-Hall London,</hi> they being charged, <hi>For deſigning to ſeize into their Cuſtody the Kings Children, ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, the L.

            <p>Some Skirmiſhes paſſed between the E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and P. <hi>Rupert,</hi> who ingaging about <hi>Tame</hi> in <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> The Prince routed a body of Horſe in <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave Field,</hi> where Mr. <hi>John Hambden</hi> recieved his mortal wounds; but in the <hi>Weſt</hi> the Parliaments Forces had better ſucceſs, where they took in the Towns of <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bridgewater;</hi> At this time finding the want of a Great Seal, the Parliament after long debates Voted, <hi>That a new Seal ſhould be made for Confirmation of their Acts and Ordinances;</hi> which was forthwith done, and thereon was Ingraven the Picture of the Houſe of Commons and Members ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and on the other ſide the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66116:66"/>
               <hi>Ireland;</hi> but between the Voting and making this Seal, they paſſed this Order, <hi>That if the L.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 5. 1643. Sir <hi>Will. Waller</hi> meets with Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi>'s Forces at <hi>Landſdown</hi> near <hi>Bath,</hi> who though fewer than Sir <hi>Williams,</hi> yet maintained the fight from two in the afternoon till one the next morning; and then Sir <hi>Williams</hi> Party forſook the Field; <hi>Hopton</hi> himſelf was hurt, and loſt divers Gentlemen of note, but the Parliaments loſs was more; <hi>Hopton</hi> marches to the <hi>Devizes</hi> in <hi>Wilt-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> after him; whereupon the King ſent 1500 Horſe from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Hoptons</hi> relief; <hi>Waller</hi> draws off to <hi>Roundway Down,</hi> and there the Fight began, in which the Parliamentarians were defeated and fled, leaving the Foot to the mercy of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, by whom hundreds of them were Slain, and more taken, with four braſs Guns, Ammunition and Baggage, 28 Colours, and 9 Cornets; <hi>Waller</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus loſt his Army, poſts to <hi>London</hi> with a few followers for Recruits. This Fight happened <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Some difference ariſing in the <hi>North</hi> between L. <hi>Fairfax</hi> General for the Parliament, and Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> Governour of <hi>Hull,</hi> who refuſed to ſubmit to the L. <hi>Fairfax;</hi> the Parliament deſigned to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place <hi>Hotham,</hi> which he diſcovering by an intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Letter, began to project new deſigns, and his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66116:67"/>Son Capt. <hi>Hotham</hi> being ſuſpected by the Parliament was impriſoned at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> but made his eſcape and underhand Treated with the E. of <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> Upon which Orders were ſent for ſeizing both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, which was done accordingly, together with his wife, and the reſt of his Children, who were all ſent up Priſoners to the Parliament; and ſome Months after Sir <hi>John</hi> and his Son were brought to Tryal in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> the E. of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> and others being aſſigned their Judges; and the Father is charged, <hi>That he had Traiterouſly betrayed the Truſt repoſed in him by the Parliament, and adhered to the Enemy, as appeared by his Words, by his Letters, and by his Actions, and that he held correſpondence with the Queen, the E. of</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>L.</hi> Digby, <hi>and others of that Party, and had endeavoured to betray</hi> Hull <hi>to them.</hi> His Son was charged with things of the ſame nature; upon which they were both Sentenced to be Beheaded, which was accordingly Executed, the Son <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. 1644. and the Father, the next day after.</p>
            <p>But to return; <hi>July</hi> 4. 1643. P. <hi>Rupert</hi> ſits down before <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and though Coll. <hi>Fines</hi> had formerly hanged up ſome Citizens for intending to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up the Town to the Prince, yet nevertheleſs the deſign took effect, for being at that time very ill provided for reſiſtance, (which P. <hi>Rupert</hi> had notice of from his Correſpondents within) the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was conſtrained after 3 days Siege, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render it to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aug.</hi> 12. the E. of <hi>Lindſey</hi> being freed from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment wherein he was ſince <hi>Edge-hill</hi> fight, came to the King at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and ſoon after P. <hi>Maurice</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Exeter,</hi> flinging in Granadoes and firing part of the Suburbs, upon which a fruitleſs Parley enſued; the next day the Prince maſters the Great Sconce,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66116:67"/>and turns the great Guns thereon upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and then the Garriſon agreed to yield, the Officers only to part with their Swords, and the private Souldiers to march out with Cudgels in their hands. At this time Judge <hi>Berkley</hi> who had been impriſoned by the Parliament about <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,</hi> was fined Twenty thouſand pound, made incapable of all Offices, and to continue a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner during pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Parliament were now buſied for recruiting Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>'s Army, and to incline the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> to a more chearfull compliance, <hi>Pennington</hi> the L. Maior was made Lieutenant of the Tower; yet <hi>Waller</hi> was forced to ſtay becauſe <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army wanted likewiſe Reinforcement; <hi>Eſſex</hi> muſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ten thouſand men at <hi>Hounſlow Heath;</hi> but this would not ſerve for ſo weighty an Affair as the relief of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> now beſieged by the King, and he muſt therefore make uſe of the <hi>London</hi> Trained Bands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was the place which ſtopt the current of the Kings ſucceſſes; <hi>Maſſey</hi> was Governour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and had with him two Regiments of Foot, and an 100 Horſe, which with ſome other Recruits made up 1500 men, with forty Barels of Powder, and a ſlender Artillery; yet they within behaved themſelves like men of Reſolution, and Allarum'd the Beſiegers with frequent Sallies; The King plants his Cannon againſt the Gates, which made above 150 ſhot, and the Granadoes did ſome Execution in the Town, yet nothing abated the Spirits of the People. Whereupon the King prepares for a General Storm, and all was ready, they within being in want and having but three Barrels of Powder left, when news comes that <hi>Eſſex</hi> was on his March with a powerfull Army to raiſe the Siege; whereupon after conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66116:68"/>had by the King with the General Officers, it was reſolved, the Kings Army ſhould draw off, which was done, and all their Hutts were ſet on fire, and <hi>Sept.</hi> 5. 1643. <hi>Eſſex</hi> enters into <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and having furniſhed the City plentifully with proviſions, went after the King, who at that Siege loſt that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of marching up to <hi>London</hi> (the Parliament having then no conſiderable Army in the Field) which he could never regain.</p>
            <p>The War had hitherto continued in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army had commonly ſucceſs againſt the Rebels, but the King now underſtanding the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contracting with the <hi>Scots</hi> for aid; thought fit to ſtrengthen himſelf by recalling part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there, hither; and commiſſionated the E. of <hi>Ormond</hi> his Lieut. General, to agree on a ceſſation for a year, which was concluded at <hi>Singeſton,</hi> and <hi>Sept.</hi> 18. 1643. was proclaimed by the Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Council at <hi>Dublin;</hi> and ſoon after ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from thence landed in <hi>Wales,</hi> and took <hi>Hawerden</hi> Caſtle near <hi>Cheſter</hi> for the King.</p>

I am ſworn to keep the Peace by that duty I owe to God and my Country, and I will do it to the laſt breath of my body, and therefore you ſhall do well to ſatifie firſt God, and then the Country, by what Authority
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66116:80"/>you do it; if you do it by a uſurped Authority, that will not laſt long. There is a God in Heaven that will call you, and all that give you power, to account: Satisfie me in that, and I will anſwer, otherwiſe I betray my truſt, and the Liberties of the People, and therefore think of that, and then I ſhall be willing. For I do avow, that it is as great a ſin to withſtand lawful Authority, as it is to ſubmit to a Tyrannical, or any other wayes unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority; and therefore ſatisfie God, and me, and all the World in that, and you ſhall receive my Anſwer: I am not afraid of the Bill.</q>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Solicitor.</hi> May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, my Lord Preſident, I did at the laſt Court in the behalf of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> exhibit and give into this Court a Charge of High Treaſon and other high Crimes, againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, whereof I do accuſe him in the name of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> and the Charge was read unto
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66116:81"/>him, and his Anſwer required. My Lord, he was not then pleaſed to give an Anſwer, but in ſtead of anſwering, did there diſpute the Authority of this High Court.

                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, You may remember at the laſt Court, you were told the occaſion of your being brought hither, and you heard a Charge againſt you, containing a Charge of high Treaſon, and other high Crimes, againſt this Realm of <hi>England;</hi> you heard likewiſe that it was prayed in the behalf of the People, that you ſhould give an anſwer to that Charge, that thereupon ſuch proceedings might be had, as ſhould be agreeable to juſtice; you were then pleaſed to make ſome ſcruples concerning the Authority of this Court, and knew not by what Authority you were brought hither; you did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times propound your Queſtions, and were as often anſwered, that it was by Authority of the <hi>Commons of England aſſembled in Parliament,</hi> that did think fit to call you to an account for thoſe high and capital miſdemeanours wherewith you were then charged. Since that, the Court hath taken into Conſideration what you then ſaid; they are fully ſatisfied with their own Authority, and they hold it fit you ſhould ſtand ſatisfied with it too; and they do require it, that you do give a poſitive and particular Anſwer to this Charge that is exhibited againſt you, they do expect you ſhould either confeſs or deny it; if you deny, it is offered in the behalf of the Nation to be made good againſts
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66116:81"/>you; their Authority they do avow to the whole world, that the whole Kingdom are to reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in, and you are to reſt ſatisfied with it, and therefore you are to loſe no more time, but to give a poſitive Anſwer thereunto.</p>

                  <q>
                     <p>When I was here laſt, 'tis true, I made that Queſtion, and truly if it were onely my own particular caſe, I would have ſatisfied my ſelf with the Proteſtation I made the laſt time I was here againſt the Legality of this Court, and that a King cannot be tryed by any Superiour Juriſdiction on Earth; but it is not my caſe alone, it is the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and the Liberty of the people of <hi>England;</hi> and do you pretend what you will, I ſtand more for their Liberties. For if power without Law, may make Laws, may alter the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, I do not know what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he is in <hi>England,</hi> that can be ſure of his life, or any thing that he calls his own; therefore when that I came here, I did expect particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to know by what Law, what Authority you did proceed againſt me here, and therefore I am a little to ſeek what to ſay to you in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, becauſe the Affirmative is proved, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative often is very hard to do: but ſince I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade you to do it, I ſhall tell you my Reaſons as ſhort as I can.</p>
                     <p>My Reaſons why in Conſcience, and the duty I owe to God firſt, and my People next, for the preſervation of their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates; I conceive I cannot anſwer this, till I be ſatisfied of the legality of it.</p>

                     <q>Sir by your favour, I do not know the forms of Law, I do know Law and Reaſon, though I am no Lawyer profeſſed, yet I know as much Law as any Gentleman in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore (under favour) I do plead for the Liberties of the People of <hi>England</hi> more than you do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I ſhould impoſe a belief upon any man without Reaſons given for it, it were unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but I muſt tell you, That by that Reaſon that I have as thus informed, I cannot yield unto it.</q>

                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I muſt interrupt you, you may not be permitted; you ſpeak of Law and Reaſon, it is fit there ſhould be Law and Reaſon, and there is both againſt you. Sir, the Vote of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> Aſſembled in Parliament, it is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Kingdom, and they are theſe too that have given that Law, according to which you ſhould have ruled and reigned. Sir, you are not to diſpute our Authority, you are told it again by the Court. Sir, it will be taken notice of, that you ſtand in contempt of the Court, and your contempt will be recorded accordingly.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you have offered ſomething to the Court, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething unto you the ſence of the Court; Sir, neither you nor any man are permitted to diſpute that point, you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, you may not demur the Juriſdiction of the Court; if you do, I muſt let you know, that they over-rule your Demurrer, they ſit here by the Authority of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and all your Predeceſſors, and you are reſponſible to them.</p>

                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir you ought not to interrupt while the Court is ſpeaking to you, this point is not to be debated by you, neither will the Court permit you to do it; if you offer it by way of Demurrer to the Juriſdiction of the Court, they have conſidered of their Juriſdiction, they do affirm their own Juriſdiction.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is now the third time that by the great grace, and favour of this High Court, the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath been brought to the Bar, before any Iſſue joyned in the Cauſe. My Lord, I did at the firſt Court exhibit a Charge againſt him, containing the higheſt Treaſon that ever was wrought upon the Theatre of <hi>England:</hi> that a King of <hi>England,</hi> truſted to keep the Law, That had taken an Oath ſo to do, That had Tribute paid him for that end, ſhould be guilty of a wicked deſign to ſubvert and deſtroy our Lawes, and introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in the defiance of the Parliament and their Authority, ſet up his Standard for War againſt his Parliament and People; and I did
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66116:85"/>humbly pray, in the behalf of the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> that he might ſpeedily be required to make an anſwer to the Charge.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, inſtead of making any Anſwer, he did then diſpute the Authority of this High Court; your Lordſhip was pleaſed to give him a further day to conſider, and to put in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which day being yeſterday, I did humbly move that he might be required to give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and poſitive anſwer, either by denying, or confeſſion of it; but (my Lord) he was then pleaſed for to demurre to the Juriſdiction of the Court, which the Court did then overrule, and command him to give a direct and poſitive Anſwer. My Lord, beſides this great delay of, Juſtice, I ſhall now humbly move your Lordſhip for ſpeedy Judgment againſt him. My Lord, I might preſſe your Lordſhip upon the whole, That according to the known Rules of the Law of the Land, That if a Priſoner ſhall ſtand as contumacious in contempt, and ſhall not put in an iſſuable plea, Guilty or not Guilty of the Charge given againſt him, whereby he may come to a fair Tryal; That as by an implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it may be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> as it hath been done to thoſe who have deſerved more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than the Priſoner at the Bar has done: but beſides, my Lord, I ſhall humbly preſſe your Lordſhip upon the whole Fact; the Houſe of Commons, the Supream Authority and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kingdom, they have declared, That it is notorious, That the matter of the Charge is true, as it is in truth (my Lord) as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chryſtal, and as the Sun that ſhines at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; which if your Lordſhip and the Court be not ſatisfied in, I have notwithſtanding, on the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66116:85"/>people of <hi>Englands</hi> behalf, ſeveral witneſſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: And therefore I do humbly pray, and yet I muſt confeſs it is not ſo much I, as the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood that hath been ſhed, the cry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is very great for juſtice and judgment, and therefore I do humbly pray, that ſpeedy <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> be pronounced againſt the Priſoner at the Bar.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you have heard what is moved by the Councel on the behalf of the Kingdom againſt you. Sir, you may well remember, and if you do not, the Court cannot forget, what dilatory deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the Court hath found at your hands: you were pleaſed to propound ſome Queſtions, you have had your Reſolutions upon them. You were told over and over again, That the Court did affirm their own juriſdiction: That it was not for you, nor any other man, to diſpute the <hi>Juriſdiction of the Supreme and higheſt Authority of</hi> England, from which there is no Appeal, and touching which there muſt be no diſpute; yet you did perſiſt in ſuch carriage, as you gave no manner of obedience, nor did you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Authority in them, nor the <hi>High Court, that conſtituted this Court of Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, I muſt let you know from the Court, That they are very ſenſible of theſe delays of yours, and that they ought not, being thus Authorized by the ſupreme <hi>Court of England,</hi> to be thus trifled withall, and that they might in juſtice, if they pleaſed, and according to the Rules of Juſtice, take advantage of theſe delayes, and proceed to pronounce judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt you; yet nevertheleſs they are pleaſed to give direction, and on their behalfs I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you, that you make a poſitive Anſwer unto this Charge that is againſt you: Sir, in plain terms; for Juſtice knows no reſpect of perſons, you are to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66116:86"/>give your poſitive and final Anſwer in plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> whether you be guilty or not guilty of theſe Treaſons laid to your Charge.</p>

                  <q>When I was here yeſterday, I did deſire to ſpeak for the <hi>Liberties of the People of England;</hi> I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted: I deſire to know yet whether I may ſpeak freely or not.</q>

                  <p>Sir you have had the Reſolution of the Court upon the like Queſtion the laſt day, and you were told, That having ſuch a Charge of ſo high a Nature againſt you, your Work was, that you ought to acknowledge the juriſdiction of the Court, <hi>and to Anſwer to your Charge.</hi> Sir, if you Anſwer to your Charge, which the Court gives you leave now to do, though they might have taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of your Contempt, yet if you be able to Anſwer to your Charge, when you have once An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, you ſhall be heard at large, make the beſt Defence you can. But Sir, I muſt let you know from the Court, as their commands, that you are not to be permitted to iſſue out into any other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, till ſuch time as you have given a poſitive Anſwer concerning the <hi>Matter</hi> that is <hi>Charged</hi> upon you.</p>

                     <q>For the <hi>Charge</hi> I value it not a Ruſh, it is the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the people of <hi>England</hi> that I ſtand for; for me to acknowledge a new <hi>Court,</hi> that I never heard of before, I that am your King, that ſhould be an example to all the people of <hi>England,</hi> for to uphold Juſtice, to maintain the old Laws; indeed I do not know how to do it; you ſpoke very well the firſt day that I came here, (on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) of the Obligations that I had laid upon me by God, to the maintenance of <hi>the Libertyes of my People:</hi> The ſame Obligation you ſpeak of, I do
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66116:86"/>
acknowledge to God that I owe to Him, and to my people, to defend, as much as in me lies, the ancient Laws of the Kingdom; therefore until that I may know that this is not againſt the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws</hi> of the Kingdom, by your favour, I can put in no particular Anſwer: If you will give me time, I will then ſhew you my Reaſons why I cannot do it, and this —</q>

                     <q>By your favour, you ought not to interrupt me; how I came here, I know not, there's no Law for it, to make your King your Priſoner: I was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Treaty upon the publick Faith of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that was the known — the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament, that was the Repreſentative of the Kingdom, and when that I had almoſt made an end of the Treaty, then I was hurried away and brought hither, and therefore—</q>

                  <p>Gentlemen, it is well known to all, or moſt of you here preſent, That the Priſoner at the Bar hath been ſeveral times convented
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66116:88"/>and brought before the Court to make anſwer to a Charge of Treaſon and other high Crimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited againſt him in the Name of the People of <hi>England;</hi> to which Charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required to Anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Here an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lady inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Court, ſaying,</hi> Not half the People, <hi>but ſhe was ſoon ſilenced.</hi>
                     </note> he hath been ſo far from obeying the Commands of the Court, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to their Juſtice, as he began to take upon him to offer reaſoning and debate unto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Court, and of the higheſt Court that conſtituted them to try and judge him; but being over-ruled in that, and required to make his Anſwer, he was ſtill pleaſed to continue contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to refuſe to ſubmit or Anſwer: Hereupon the Court, that they may not be wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the truſt repoſed in them, nor that any mans wilfulneſs prevent Juſtice, they have thought fit to take the matter into their conſideration; They have conſidered of the Contumacy, and of that confeſſion which in Law doth ariſe upon that contumacy; They have likewiſe conſidered of the notoriety of the Fact charged upon the Priſoner, and upon the whole matter they are reſolved, and have agreed upon a Sentence to be now pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt this Priſoner: but in reſpect he doth deſire to be heard before the Sentence be read and pronounced, the Court hath reſolved that they will hear him; yet Sir, thus much I muſt tell you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, which you have been minded of at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts; that if that you have to ſay be to offer any Debate concerning juriſdiction, you are not to be heard in it, you have offered it formerly, and you have indeed ſtruck at the root, that is, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and <hi>Supreme Authority of the Commons of England,</hi> which this Court will not admit a debate of, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66116:88"/>which indeed is an irrational thing in them to do, being a Court that acts upon Authority denived from them, that they ſhould preſume to judge upon their Superiority, from whom there is no Appeal. But Sir, if you have any thing to ſay in defence of your ſelf concerning the matters charged, the Court hath given me command to let you know they will hear you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <q>Since that I ſee that you will not hear any thing of debate concerning that which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I thought moſt material for the peace of the Kingdom, and for the Liberty of the Subject, I ſhall wave it, I ſhall ſpeak nothing to it; but only I muſt tell you, That this many a day all things have been taken away from me, but that, that I call more dear to me than my life, which is <hi>My Conſcience and my Honour;</hi> and if I had reſpect to my life more than the Peace of the Kingdom, the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> certainly I ſhould have made a particular defence for my ſelf, for by that at leaſt-wiſe I might have delayed an ugly Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which I believe will paſs upon me; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly, Sir, as a man that hath ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſome knowledge of the world, if that my true zeal to my Countrey had not overborn the care that I have of my own preſervation, I ſhould have gone another way to work than that I have done: Now Sir, I conceive that an haſtie Sentence once paſt, may be ſooner repented than recalled: And truly the ſelf ſame deſire that I have for <hi>the Peace of the Kingdome, and the Liberty of the Subject, more than my own particular,</hi> does make me now at laſt deſire, That having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for to ſay that concerns both, I deſire before Sentence be given, that I may be heard in the Painted Chamber before the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66116:89"/>this delay cannot be prejudicial to you whatſoever I ſay, if that I ſay no Reaſon, thoſe that hear me muſt be Judges, I cannot be Judge of that that I have; if it be Reaſon, and really for the <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject,</hi> I am ſure on it very well, it is worth the hearing; Therefore I do conjure you, as you love that you pretend, I hope it is real, <hi>the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Peace of the Kingdom;</hi> that you will grant Me the hearing, before any Sentence be paſſed; I only deſire this, that you will take this into your conſideration, it may be you have not heard of it before-hand; if you will, I'le retire, and you may think of it: but if I cannot get this <hi>Liberty,</hi> I do here proteſt, that ſo fair ſhews of <hi>Liberty and Peace</hi> are pure ſhews, and not otherwiſe, then that you will not hear your KING.</q>

Sir, That notwithſtanding that you would offer to the Lords nnd Commons in the Painted Chamber, yet nevertheleſs you would proceed on here, I did hear you ſay ſo; but Sir, that you would offer there, whatever it is, muſt needs be in delay of the Juſtice here; ſo as if this Court be reſolved, and prepared for the Sentence, this that you offer they are not bound in juſtice to grant; but Sir, according to that you ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and becauſe you ſhall know the further plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Court upon that which you have moved, the Court will withdraw for a time.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66116:90"/>you, and notwithſtanding what you have offered, they are reſolved to proceed to puniſhment, and to Judgment, and that is their unanimous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>

                     <q>Sir, I know it is in vain for me to diſpute, I am no <hi>Sceptick</hi> for to deny the power that you have, I know that you have power enough; Sir, I confeſs I think it would have been for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms peace, if you would have taken the pains for to have ſhown the lawfulneſs of your power; for this delay that I have deſired, I confeſs it is a delay, but it is a delay very important for the peace of the Kingdom, for it is not my Perſon that I look on alone, it is the Kingdoms welfare, and the Kingdoms peace: it is an old ſentence, <hi>That we ſhould think on long, before we have reſolved of great matters ſuddenly;</hi> Therefore, Sir, I do ſay again, that I do put at your doors all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of an haſty Sentence; I confeſs, I have been here now I think this week, this day eight daies, was the day I came here firſt, but a little delay of a day or two further, may give peace, whereas an <hi>Haſty Judgment</hi> may bring on that trouble and perpetual inconveniency to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that the Child that is unborn may repent it; and therefore again out of the Duty I owe to God, and to my Countrey, I do deſire that I may be heard by the Lords and Commons in the <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chamber,</hi> or any other Chamber that you will appoint me.</q>

                  <p>The Court then Sir, hath ſomething to ſay unto you, which although I know it will be very unacceptable, yet notwithſtanding they are willing, and are reſolved to diſcharge their Duty.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you ſpeak very well of a precious thing that you call Peace, and it had been much to be wiſhed that God had put it into your heart, that you had as effectually and really endeavoured and ſtudied the Peace of the Kingdom, as now in words you ſeem to pretend; but as you were told the other day, <hi>Actions muſt expound Intentions,</hi> yet Actions have been clean contrary; and truly Sir, it doth appear plainly enough to them, that you have gone upon very erroneous principles; the Kingdom hath felt it to their ſmart, and it will be no eaſe to you to think of it; for Sir, you have held your ſelf, and let fall ſuch Language, as if you had been no wayes ſubject to the Law, or that the Law had not been your Superiour. Sir, the Court is very well ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, and I hope ſo are all the underſtanding people of <hi>England, That the Law is your Superiour:</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:66116:91"/>That you ought to have ruled according to the Law, you ought to have done ſo Sir: I know very well your pretence hath been that you have done ſo, but Sir, the difference hath been, who ſhall be the <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of this Law;</hi> Sir, whether you and your party out of Courts of Juſtice, ſhall take upon them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Law, or the <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> who are the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders; nay, the Soveraign and <hi>the High Court of Juſtice,</hi> the <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> who are not onely <hi>the higheſt Expounders,</hi> but <hi>the ſole Makers of the Law.</hi> Sir, for you to ſet your ſelf with your ſingle judgment, and thoſe that adhere unto you, againſt <hi>the higheſt Court of Juſtice, that is not Law:</hi> Sir, as the Law is your ſuperiour, ſo truly Sir, there is ſomething that is ſuperior to the Law, and that is indeed the <hi>Parent or Author</hi> of the Law, and that is <hi>the People of England.</hi> For Sir, as they are thoſe that at the firſt, (as other Countreys have done) did chuſe to themſelves this <hi>Form of Government,</hi> even for Juſtice ſake, that Juſtice might be adminiſtred, that Peace might be preſerved; ſo Sir, they gave Laws to their Governors, according to which they ſhould govern; and if thoſe Laws ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inconvenient, or prejudicial to the publick, they had a power in them, and reſerved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to alter as they ſhould ſee cauſe. Sir, it is very true, what ſome of your ſide have ſaid, <hi>Rex non habet parem in Regno;</hi> This Court will ſay the ſame while <hi>King, That you have not your Peer</hi> in ſome ſence, for you are <hi>Major ſingulis,</hi> but they will averr again, that you are <hi>Minor univerſis;</hi> and the ſame Author tells you, that <hi>in exhibitione juris,</hi> there you have no power, but are <hi>quaſi minimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This we know to be Law, <hi>Rex habet ſuperiorem, Deum &amp; Legem, etiam &amp; Curiam,</hi> and ſo ſays the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66116:92"/>ſame Author; and truly Sir, he makes bold to go a little further, <hi>Debent ei ponere fraenum, They ought to bridle him;</hi> and Sir, we know very well the ſtories of old; Thoſe Wars that were called the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> when the Nobility of the Land did ſtand out <hi>for the Liberty and Property of the Subject,</hi> and would not ſuffer the Kings that did invade to play the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants here, but called them to account for it, we know that truth, That they did <hi>fraenum ponere:</hi> But Sir, if they do forbear to do their duty now, and are not ſo mindful of their own honour and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms good, certainly the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> will not be unmindful of what is for their preſervation, and for their ſafety: <hi>Juſtitiae fruendi cauſa Reges conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuti ſunt.</hi> This we learn is the end of having Kings, or any other Governours, it's for the enjoying of Juſtice, that's the end. Now Sir, if ſo be the King will go contrary to the end of his Government; Sir, he muſt underſtand that he is but an Officer of truſt, and he ought to diſcharge that truſt, and they are to take order for the animadverſion and puniſhment of ſuch an offending Governour.</p>
                  <p>This is not Law of yeſterday, Sir, (ſince the time of the diviſion betwixt you and your People,) but it is Law of old; And we know very well the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> and <hi>Authorities</hi> that do tell us what the Law was in that point upon the Election of Kings, upon the <hi>Oath</hi> that they took unto their People, and if they did not obſerve it, there weere thoſe things cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Parliaments; The <hi>Parliaments</hi> were they that were to adjudge (the very words of the <hi>Author</hi>) <hi>the plaints and wrongs done of the King and Queen, or their Children; ſuch wrongs eſpecially, when the People could have no where elſe any remedy.</hi> Sir, that hath been the People of <hi>Englands</hi> caſe, they could not have their remedy elſewhere but in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:66116:92"/>
                  <p>Sir, <hi>Parliaments</hi> were ordained for that purpoſe, to redreſs the grievances of the People, that was their main end; and truly Sir, if ſo be that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had been rightly mindful of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they were never more in <hi>Majeſty and State,</hi> than in the <hi>Parliament:</hi> but how forgetfull ſome have been, <hi>Hiſtories</hi> have told us; We have a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a lamentable, a ſad experience of it. Sir, by the old Laws of <hi>England,</hi> (I ſpeak theſe things the rather to you, becauſe you were pleaſed to let fall the other day, you thought you had as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Law, as moſt Gentlemen in <hi>England;</hi> it is very well Sir. And truly Sir, it is very good for the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> to underſtand that Law under which they muſt live, and by which they muſt be governed. And then Sir, the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays, <hi>They that know their Maſters Will and do it not,</hi> what follows. The Law is your Maſter, the Acts of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>) the <hi>Parliaments</hi> were to be kept anciently, we find in our <hi>Author,</hi> twice in the year, <hi>That the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon any occaſion, might have a ready remedy and redreſſe for his Grievance.</hi> Afterwards, by ſeveral Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> in the dayes of your Predeceſſor <hi>Edward</hi> the third, they muſt have been once a year. Sir, what intermiſſion of PARLIAMENTS hath been in your time, it is very well known, and the ſad conſequences of it, and what in the interim inſtead of theſe Parliaments, hath been by you, by an high and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> hand introduced upon the People, that likewiſe hath been too well known and felt. But when God by his Providence had ſo brought it about, that you could no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the calling of a Parliament; Sir, yet it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what your ends were againſt the Ancient, and your Native Kingdom of <hi>Scotland:</hi> The <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:66116:93"/>of <hi>England,</hi> not ſerving your ends againſt them, you were pleaſed to diſſolve it. Another great neceſſity occaſioned the calling of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what your deſigns and plots and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all along have been for the ruining and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of this Parliament, hath been very noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the whole Kingdom; And truly Sir, in that you did ſtrike at all; that had been a ſure way to have brought about that that this layes upon you, <hi>Your Intention to ſubvert the Fundamental Laws of the Land.</hi> For the great bulwark of <hi>Liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> is the PARLIAMENT of <hi>England;</hi> and to Subvert and Root up that, which your aim hath been to do, certainly at one blow you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Liberties and the Propriety of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, it makes me call to mind, I cannot forbear to expreſs it, for Sir, we muſt deal plainly with you, according to the merits of your cauſe, ſo is our Commiſſion; it makes me call to mind (theſe proceedings of yours) that we read of a great <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> by the way let us call him <hi>a great Roman Tyrant,</hi> Caligula, <hi>that wiſht that the People of</hi> Rome <hi>had had but one Neck, that at one blow he might cut it off:</hi> and your proceedings hath been ſomewhat like to this, for the body of the people of <hi>England</hi> hath been (and where elſe repreſented but) in the Parliament, and could you have but confounded that, you had at one blow cut off the neck of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> but God hath reſerved better things for us, and hath pleaſed for to Confound your deſigns, and to break your Forces, and to bring your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into Cuſtodie, that you might be reſponſible to Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Sir, we know very well, That it is a queſtion on your ſide very much Preſs'd, <hi>By what preſident we
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66116:93"/>ſhall proceed?</hi> Truly Sir, for <hi>Preſidents,</hi> I ſhall not at this preſent make any long diſcourſe, but it is no new thing to cite <hi>Preſidents</hi> almoſt of all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> where the People (when power hath been in their hands) have not ſticked to call their Kings to account, and where the change of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> hath enſued upon occaſions of the <hi>Tyranny and Miſ-government</hi> of thoſe that have been placed over them; I will not ſpend time to mention <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Empire, or other Countries, Volumes may be written of them; But truly Sir, that of the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> I ſhould think ſome of us have thought upon it, where they have the Juſtice of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that is a man <hi>tanquam in medio poſitus,</hi> betwixt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the people of the Country, that if wrong be done by the King, he that is the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Juſtice hath power to reform the wrong, and he is acknowledged to be the Kings Superiour, and is the grand preſerver of their priviledges, and hath proſecuted Kings upon their miſcarriages.</p>
                  <p>Sir, What the Tribunes of <hi>Rome</hi> were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and what the <hi>Ephori</hi> were to the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian State,</hi> we know that is the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh State;</hi> and though <hi>Rome</hi> ſeem to have loſt its <hi>liberty</hi> when once the Emperours were, yet you ſhall find ſome famous Acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice even done by the Senate of <hi>Rome;</hi> that great <hi>Tyrant</hi> of his time, <hi>Nero,</hi> condemned and judged by the <hi>Senate.</hi> But truly Sir, to you I ſhould not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe Forreign examples and ſtories. If you look but over <hi>Tweed,</hi> we find enough in your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> If we look to your firſt King <hi>Forguſius,</hi> that your ſtories make mention of, he was an Elective King, he died, and left two Sons both in their minority, the Kingdom made choice
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66116:94"/>of their Unkle his Brother to govern in the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; afterwards the Elder Brother giving ſmall hopes to the People that he would rule or govern well, ſeeking to ſupplant that good Unkle of his, that governed them juſtly, they ſet the Elder aſide, and took to the Younger. Sir, if I ſhould come to what your ſtories make mention of, you know very well you are the 109th King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for to mention ſo many Kings as that Kingdom, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their power and priviledge, have made bold to deal withal, ſome to baniſh, and ſome to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſome to put to death, it would be too long; and as one of your Authors ſayes, it would be too long to recite the manifold examples that your own ſtories make mention of; <hi>Reges</hi> (ſay they) we do create, we created Kings at firſt; <hi>Leges;</hi> &amp;c. We impoſed Lawes upon them; and as they are choſen by the ſuffrages of the People at the firſt, ſo upon juſt occaſion, by the ſame ſuffrages, they may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down again: and we will be bold to ſay, that no Kingdom hath yielded more plentiful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than that your Native Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath done, concerning the depoſition and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their offending and tranſgreſſing Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not far to go for an example near you, your Grandmother ſet aſide, and your Father an Infant crowned; and the State did it here in <hi>England;</hi> here hath not been a want of ſome examples, they have made bold (the Parliament and the People of <hi>England</hi>) to call their Kings to account, there are frequent examples of it in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, the time before the Conqueſt; ſince the Conqueſt there wants not ſome Preſidents neither; King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, were dealt with ſo by the Parliament, as they were depoſed and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66116:94"/>deprived: and truly Sir, whoever ſhall look into their ſtories, they ſhall not find the Articles that are charged upon them to come near to that height and capitalneſs of Crimes that are layed to your charge, nothing near.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you were pleaſed to ſay the other day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they deſcend, and I did not contradict it, but take altogether: Sir, if you were as the Charge ſpeaks, and no otherwiſe admitted K. of <hi>England,</hi> but for that you were pleaſed then to alledge, how that almoſt for a thouſand years theſe things have been, ſtories will tell you, if you go no higher than the time of the Conqueſt; if you do come down ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, you are the 24th King from <hi>William</hi> called the Conqueror, you ſhall find one half of them to come meerly from the State, and not meerly upon the point of Deſcent; it were eaſie to be inſtanced to you, the time muſt not be loſt that way. And truly Sir, what a grave and learned Judge ſaid in his time, and well known to you, is ſince printed for poſterity, <hi>That although there was ſuch a thing as a Deſcent many times, yet the Kings of</hi> England <hi>ever held the greateſt aſſurance of their titles, when it was declared by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And Sir, your <hi>Oath,</hi> the manner of your <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> doth ſhew plainly, That the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and though it's true by the Law the next perſon in blood is deſigned; yet if there were juſt cauſe to refuſe him, the people of <hi>England</hi> might do it. For there is a <hi>Contract</hi> and Bargain made between the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi> and your <hi>Oath</hi> is taken, and certainly Sir, the Bond is reciprocal; for as you are the liege Lord, ſo they liege Subjects, and we know very well that hath been ſo much ſpoken of, <hi>Ligan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eſt duplex.</hi> This we know now, the one tye, the one Bond, is the bond of perfection which is due from the Soveraign, the other is the bond of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66116:95"/>that is due from the Subject. Sir, if this bond be once broken, farewel Soveraignty, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectio trahit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things may not be denyed, Sir; I ſpeak it the rather, and I pray God it may work upon your heart, that you may be ſenſible of your miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For whether you have been, as by your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice you ought to be, <hi>a Protector</hi> of England, or <hi>the Deſtroyer of</hi> England, let all <hi>England</hi> judge, or all the world that hath look'd upon it. Sir, though you have it by <hi>Inheritance</hi> in the way that is ſpoken of, yet it muſt not be denyed that your Office was an Office of Truſt, and an Office of the higheſt truſt lodged in any ſingle perſon: For as you were the grand <hi>Adminiſtrator of Juſtice,</hi> and others were as your <hi>Delegates,</hi> to ſee it done throughout your Realms, if your great Office were to do Juſtice, and preſerve your People from wrong, and inſtead of doing that, you will be the <hi>great wrong-doer your ſelf;</hi> If, inſtead of being a <hi>Conſervator of the Peace,</hi> you will be <hi>the Grand Diſturber of the Peace,</hi> ſurely this is contrary to your Office, contrary to your Truſt. Now Sir, if it be an Office of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> as you ſpeak of, your Title by <hi>Deſcent,</hi> let all men know that great Offices are ſeizable and forfeitable, as if you had it but for a year, and for your life; Therefore Sir, it will concern you to take into your ſerious conſideration your great miſcarriages in this kind.</p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, I ſhall not particularize the many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of your Reign whatſoever, they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly known, it had been happy for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and happy for you too, if it had not been ſo much known and ſo much felt, as the ſtory of your miſcarriages muſt needs be, and hath been already.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:66116:95"/>
                  <p>Sir, That that we are now upon by the command of the <hi>higheſt Court,</hi> hath been and is to Trie and Judge you for great offences of <hi>yours.</hi> Sir, the <hi>Charge</hi> hath called you <hi>Tyrant, a Traytor, a Murtherer, and a publick Enemy to the Common-wealth of</hi> England. Sir, it had been well if that any of all theſe terms might rightly and juſtly have been ſpared, if any one of them at all.</p>

                  <p>Truly Sir, we have been told, <q xml:lang="lat">
                        <hi>Rex eſt dum bene regit, Tyrannus qui populum opprimet;</hi>
                     </q> and if ſo be that be the definition of a Tyrant, then ſee how you come ſhort of it in your Actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the higheſt Tyrant by that way of Arbitrary Government, and that you have ſought to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and that you have ſought to put, you were putting upon the People, whether that was not as high an Act of Tyrannie as any of your Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were guilty of, nay many degrees beyond it.</p>
                  <p>Sir, the term Traytor cannot be ſpared, we ſhall eaſily agree it muſt denote and ſuppoſe a breach of Truſt, and it muſt ſuppoſe it to be done by a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; and therefore Sir, as the People of <hi>England</hi> might have incurred that reſpecting you, if they had been truly guilty of it, as to the definition of Law; ſo on the other ſide, when you did break your Truſt to the Kingdom, you did break your Truſt to your Superior: For the Kingdom is that for which you were truſted: And therefore Sir, for this breach of Truſt, when you are called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, you are called to account by your Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. <hi>Minimus ad Majorem in judicium vocat.</hi> And Sir, the <hi>People of England</hi> cannot be ſo far wanting to themſelves, which God having dealt ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly and gloriouſly for, they having power in their hands, and their great Enemy, they muſt proceed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66116:96"/>to do Juſtice to themſelves and to you: For, Sir, the Court could heartily deſire, That you would lay your hand upon your heart, and conſider what you have done amiſs: That you would endeavour to make your peace with God. Truly Sir, Theſe are your high crimes, Tyranny and Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>There is a third thing too, if thoſe had not been, and that is Murther, which is laid to your charge. All the bloody Murthers that have been committed ſince this time that the Diviſion was betwixt you and your People, muſt be laid to your charge, that have been acted or committed in theſe late Wars. Sir, it is an heinous and crying ſin; and truly Sir, if any man will ask us what puniſhment is due to a Murtherer, Let Gods Law, let Mans Law ſpeak. Sir, I will preſume that you are ſo well read in Scripture, as to know what God himſelf hath ſaid concerning <hi>the ſhedding of Mans blood: Gen.</hi> 9. <hi>Num.</hi> 35. will tell you what the puniſhment is, and which this Court in behalf of the Kingdom are ſenſible of, of that innocent blood that has been ſhed, whereby indeed the Land ſtands ſtill defiled with that blood, and as the Text hath it, <hi>It can no way be cleanſed, but with the ſhedding of the blood of him that ſhed this blood.</hi> Sir, we know no Diſpenſation from this blood in that Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murder;</hi> we do not know but that it extends to Kings, as well as to the meaneſt Peaſants, the meaneſt of the People, the command is univerſal. Sir, Gods Law forbids it, Mans Law forbids it, nor do we know that there is any manner of exception, nor even in mans Laws, for the puniſhment of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in you. 'Tis true, that in the caſe of Kings eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private hand was not to put forth it ſelf to this work for their Reformation and puniſhment. But Sir, the People repreſented having power in their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66116:96"/>hands, had there been but one wilful act of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by you committed, had power to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented you, and to have puniſhed you for it.</p>
                  <p>But then Sir, the weight that lies upon you in all thoſe reſpects that have been ſpoken, by reaſon of your <hi>Tyranny, Treaſon, breach of Truſt,</hi> and the <hi>Murthers</hi> that have been committed, ſurely Sir, it muſt drive you into a ſad conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration concerning your eternal condition: As I ſaid at firſt, I know it cannot be pleaſing to you to hear any ſuch things as theſe are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned unto you from this Court, for ſo we do call our ſelves, and juſtifie our ſelves to be a Court, and a <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> authorized by the higheſt and ſolemneſt Court of the Kingdom, as we have often ſaid; and although you do yet endeavour what you may to diſ-court us, yet we do take knowledge of our ſelves to be ſuch a Court as can adminiſter Juſtice to you, and we are bound, Sir, in duty to do it. Sir, all I ſhall ſay before the reading of your Sentence, it is but this; the Court does heartily deſire, that you will ſeriouſly think of thoſe evils that you ſtand guilty of. Sir, you ſaid well to us the other day, you wiſht us to have God before our eyes: Truly Sir, I hope all of us have ſo, that God that we know is a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> that God with whom there is no reſpect of perſons, that God that is the avenger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, we have that God before us, that God that does beſtow a Curſe upon them that withhold their hands from ſhedding of blood, which is the caſe of guilty Malefactors, and that do deſerve death; That God we have before our eyes, and were it not that the conſcience of our duty hath called us unto this place, and this
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66116:97"/>imployment, Sir, you ſhould have had no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Court here: but Sir, we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the diſcharge of our duty unto God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom, before any other reſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: and although at this time many of us, if not all of us, are ſeverely threatned by ſome of your party, what they intend to do. Sir, we do here declare, that we ſhall not decline, or forbear the doing of our duty in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice even to you, according to the merit of your offence, although God ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe men to effect all that bloody deſign in hand againſt us. Sir, we will ſay, and we will declare it, as thoſe Children in the fiery Furnace, that would not worſhip the golden Image that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had ſet up, <hi>That their God was able to deliver them from that danger that they were neer unto;</hi> but yet if he would not do it, yet, notwithſtanding that, they would not fall down and worſhip the Image: we ſhall thus apply it: That though we ſhould not be delivered from thoſe bloody hands and hearts that conſpire the overthrow of the Kingdom in general, of us in particular, for acting in this great work of Juſtice, though we ſhould periſh in the work, yet by Gods grace, and by Gods ſtrength, we will go on with it: And this is all our Reſolutions. Sir, I ſay for your ſelf, we do heartily wiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that God would be pleaſed to give you a ſence of your ſins, that you would ſee wherein you have done amiſs, that you may cry unto him, that God would deliver you from blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltineſs. A good King was once guilty of that particular thing, and was clear otherwiſe, ſaving in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> Truly Sir, the Story tells us, that he was a repentant King, and it ſignifies
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66116:97"/>enough that he had dyed for it, but that God was pleaſed to accept of him, and to give him his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: <hi>Thou ſhalt not dye, but the Child ſhall dye, thou haſt given cauſe to the enemies of God to blaſpheme.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>I would deſire only one word before you give ſentence, and that is, That you would hear me concerning thoſe great imputations that you have laid to my charge.</q>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I muſt put you in mind, Truly Sir, I would not willingly at this time, eſpecially, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you in any thing you have to ſay, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for us to admit of; but Sir, you have not owned us a Court, and you look upon us as a ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple met together, and we know what Language we receive from your party.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
                  <p>You diſavow us as a <hi>Court,</hi> and therefore for you to addreſs your ſelf to us, not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge us as a Court to judge of what You ſay, it is not to be permitted; and the <hi>truth</hi> is, all along from the firſt time, You were pleaſed to diſavow and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own us, the Court needed not to have heard You one word; for unleſs they be acknowledged a Court, and engaged, it is not proper for you to ſpeak: <hi>Sir,</hi> we have given you too much liberty already, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of too much delay, and we may not admit of any further; were it proper for us to do, we ſhould hear You freely, and we ſhould not have declined to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:66116:98"/>have heard You at large, what you could have ſaid or proved on your behalf, whether for totally excuſing or for in part excuſing thoſe great and heinous <hi>charges</hi> that in whole or in part are laid upon You. But Sir, I ſhall trouble You no longer, Your ſins are ſo large a dimenſion, that if you do but ſeriouſly think of them they will drive you to a ſad conſideration, they may improve in you a ſad and ſerious repentance. And that the <hi>Court</hi> doth heartily wiſh, that You may be ſo penitent for what You have done amiſs, that God may have mercy at leaſtwiſe upon your better part. Truly Sir, for the other, it is our parts and duties to do that that the Law preſcribes, we are not here <hi>Jus dare,</hi> but <hi>Jus dicere;</hi> We cannot be unmindful of what the Scriptures tell us, For <hi>to acquit the guilty is of equal abomination as to condemn the innocent;</hi> we may not acquit the guilty; what Sentence the Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms to a Traitor, Tyrant, a Murtherer, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy to the Countrey, that Sentence you are now to hear read unto you, and that is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Preſident</hi> commands the Sentence to be read. Make an O Yes, and command ſilence while the Sentence is read.</p>
                  <p>O Yes made, ſilence commanded.</p>
                  <p>The Clerk read the Sentence, which was drawn up in parchment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereas the Commons of</hi> England <hi>in</hi> Parliament <hi>have appointed them an high Court of Juſtice for the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>before whom he had been three times convented, and at firſt time a charge of high Treaſon, and other crimes and miſdemeanors was read in the behalf of the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Clerk read the Charge.</p>
                  <p>Which Charge being read unto him as aforeſaid, He the ſaid <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> was required to give his

                  <p>
                     <hi>For all which Treaſons and Crimes, this Court doth adjudge, That the ſaid</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murtherer, and a publique Enemy, ſhall be put to Death, by the ſevering his Head from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>

               <p>The next day, being Sunday, <hi>January</hi> 28. the King was attended by his Guard, to Saint <hi>James</hi>'s, where the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> preached privately before him; his Text was in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my Goſpel.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>His Children being come to meet him, He firſt gave his Bleſſing to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and bad her to remember to tell her Brother <hi>James,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe ſhould ſee him, that it was his Fathers laſt deſire that he ſhould no more look upon <hi>Charles</hi> as his eldeſt Brother only, but be obedient unto him as his Soveraign; and that they ſhould love one another, and forgive their Fathers Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Then ſaid the King to her, Sweet-heart you'l forget this: No (ſaid ſhe) I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it whileſt I live; and pouring forth abundance of tears, promiſed him to write down the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then the King taking the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> upon his knee, ſaid, Sweet-heart, now they will cut off thy Fathers head (upon which words the Child looking very ſtedfaſtly on him,) Mark child what I ſay, They will cut off my head, and perhaps make thee a King: But mark what I ſay, you muſt not be a King, ſo long as your brothers, <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> do live; for they will cut off your Brothers heads (when they can catch them) and cut off thy head too at laſt: and therefore I charge you do not be made a King by them. At which the child ſighing ſaid, I will be torn in pieces firſt: which falling ſo unexpectedly from one ſo young, it made the King rejoyce exceedingly.</p>

                  <hi>James</hi>'s to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> marched on foot (guarded with a Regiment of foot Souldiers) through the Park, with their Colours flying, and Drums beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his private Guard of Partizans about him, Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> on one ſide, and Collon. <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> on the other, both bare-headed, bidding them go faſter, ſaying <hi>That he now went before them to ſtrive for an heavenly Crown with leſs ſolicitude, than he had oftentimes bid his Souldiers to fight for an Earthly Diadem.</hi> Being come to the end of the Park, he aſcends the Staris leading to the long Gallery in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ſo into the <hi>Cabinet Chamber,</hi> where he formerly uſed to Lodge; there his Majeſty with the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> continued for ſome time in Devotion, and received the bleſſed Sacrament from the hand of the ſaid Biſhop; at which time he read for the ſecond Leſſon, the 27. Chapter of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> Goſpel, which contained the Hiſtory of the Death and Paſſion of our Bleſſed Saviour; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ended, his Majeſty thanked the Biſhop for ſelecting ſo ſeaſonable and comfortable a portion of Scripture. The Biſhop modeſtly replied, No thanks were due to him, for it was the Chapter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the Church for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond morning Leſſon for that day being <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. Here the King continued at his Devotion, refuſing to dine, onely about Twelve of the Clock, he eat a bit of bread, and drank a Glaſs of Claret, from thence about one a Clock he was accompanied by Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> and Coll. <hi>Thomlinſon,</hi> and other Officers formerly appointed to attend him, and the private Guard of Partizans, with Muſketeers on each ſide, through the Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-houſe, adjoyning to which the Scaffold was erected, between <hi>White-hall</hi> Gate, and the Gate leading into the Gallery from Saint <hi>James</hi>'s: The
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66116:102"/>Scaffold was hung round with Black, the Floor covered with black Bayes, and the Ax and Block laid in the middle of the Scaffold. There were divers Companies of Foot of Collonel <hi>Prides</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and ſeveral Troops of Horſe placed on the one ſide of the Scaffold toward <hi>Kings-ſtreet,</hi> and on the other ſide toward <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> and the multitudes of people that came to be Spectators very great. The King being come upon the Scaffold, it was expected he would ſay ſomewhat to the people, the which he did.</p>

                  <hi>But becauſe we have no other Relation of what his Majeſty then ſpake, ſave what was taken in ſhort hand on the Scaffold by three ſeveral Gentlemen, who were very exquiſite in that Art; nor had his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty any Copy (being ſurprized and haſtened by thoſe who attended him to the Scaffold,) ſave only a few heads in a little ſcrip of Paper, which after his death, the Souldiers took from the Biſhop of</hi> London, <hi>to whom he gave it: Therefore the Reader muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this Copy, which was by them upon joynt comparing of their Copies publiſhed, ſome few words being altered to make the ſence perfect.</hi>

               <p>The King being come upon the Scaffold, and looking about him upon the people, who were kept off by Troops of Horſe, ſo that they could not come near to hear him, omitted what he had purpoſed to have ſpoken to them (as 'tis thought) and turning himſelf to the Soldiers and Officers (the Inſtruments of the Regicide) ſpake to them to this effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <p>I Shall be very little heard of any body here, I ſhall therefore ſpeak a word unto you here: indeed I could hold my peace very well, if I did not think that holding my peace would make ſome men think, that I did ſubmit to the Guilt as well as to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I think it is my duty to God firſt, and to my Country, for to clear my ſelf both as an honeſt Man, a good King, and a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. I ſhall begin firſt with my <hi>Innocency;</hi> In troth, I think it not very needful for me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt long upon this, for all the world knows that I never did begin a War with the two houſes of Parliament, and I call God to witneſs, to whom I muſt ſhortly make an account. That I never did intend for to encroach upon their Priviledges, they began upon me; it is the Militia they began upon, they confeſt that the <hi>Militia</hi> was mine, but they thought it fit for to have it from me: and to be ſhort, if any body will look to the dates of Commiſſions, of their Commiſſions and mine, and likewiſe to the Declarations, will ſee clearly that they began theſe unhappy troubles, not I: ſo that as to the guilt of theſe enormous Crimes that are laid againſt me, I hope in God that God will clear me of; I will not, I am in charity: God
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66116:103"/>forbid that I ſhould lay it upon the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament, there is no neceſſity of either, I hope they are free of this guilt: for I do believe that ill inſtruments between them and me, has been the chief cauſe of all this blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: ſo that by way of ſpeaking, as I find my ſelf clear of this, I hope (and pray God) that they may too: yet for all this, God forbid that I ſhould be ſo ill a Chriſtian as not to ſay that Gods judgments are juſt upon me: Many times he does pay Juſtice by an unjuſt Sentence, that is ordinary. I will only ſay this, That unjuſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<note n="*" place="margin">Strafford.</note> that I ſuffered for to take effect, is puniſhed now by an unjuſt Sentence upon me: So far I have ſaid, to ſhew you that I am an Innocent man.</p>
                           <p>Now for to ſhew you that I am a good Chriſtian: I hope there is (
<note n="*" place="margin">Strafford.</note> 
                              <hi>Pointing to Dr. Juxon,</hi>) a good man that will bear me witneſs, That I have forgiven all the world, and even thoſe in particular that have been the chief cauſers of my death; who they are, God knows, I do not deſire to know, I pray God forgive them. But this is not all, my Charity muſt go further, I wiſh that they may repent, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have committed a great ſin in that particular: I pray God with St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> that this be not laid to their charge, nay not only ſo, but that they may take the right way to the peace of the Kingdom; for my Charity commands me, not only to forgive particular men, but my Charity commands me to endeavour to the laſt gaſp the Peace of the Kingdom. So (Sir) I do wiſh with all my Soul (and I do hope there is ſome here
<note n="*" place="margin">Turning to ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that wrote.</note> will carry it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66116:103"/>further) that they may endeavour the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>Now (Sirs) I muſt ſhew you both how you are out of the way, and will put you in the way: Firſt, you are out of the way, for certainly all the way you ever have had yet, as I could find by any thing, is in the way of Conqueſt; certainly this is an ill way: for Conqueſt (Sir) in my opinion is never juſt, except there be a good juſt Cauſe, either for matter of wrong, or juſt Title, and then if you goe beyond it, the firſt quarrel that you have to it, is it that makes it unjuſt at the end that was juſt at firſt: But if it be only matter of Conqueſt, then it is a great Robbery, as a Pirate ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was the great Robber, he was but a petty Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and ſo, Sir, I doe think the way that you are in, is much out of the way. Now, Sir, for to put you in one way, believe it, you will never do right, nor God will never proſper you, until you give God his due, the King his due (that is, my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors) and the People their due: I am as much for them as any of you: You muſt give God his due, by regulating rightly his Church, (according to his Scriptures) which is now out of order: For to ſet you in a way particularly, now I cannot, but only this, <hi>A National Synod freely called,</hi> freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating among themſelves, muſt ſettle this; when that every Opinion is freely and clearly heard.</p>
                           <p>For the King, indeed I will not— (<hi>Then turning to a Gentleman that touched the Ax, ſaid,</hi> Hurt not the Ax, that may hurt
<note n="*" place="margin">Meaning if he did blunt the edge.</note> me.) For the King, the Laws of the Land will clearly inſtruct you for that; therefore, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my own particular, I only give you a touch of it.</p>
                           <pb n="200" facs="tcp:66116:104"/>
                           <p>For the people: and truly I deſire their Liberty and freedom as much as any body whoſoever, but I muſt tell you, that their Liberty and freedom conſiſts in having of Government, thoſe Laws by which their Life and their Goods may be moſt their own. It is not for having ſhare in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (Sir) that is nothing pertaining to them: A Subject and a Soveraign are clean different things, and therefore until they do that, I mean, That you do put the people in that Liberty, as I ſay, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will never enjoy themſelves.</p>
                           <p>Sir, It was for this that now I am come here: If I would have given way to an Arbitrarie way, for to have all Laws changed according to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here; and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your charge) that <hi>I am the Martyr of the people.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Introth Sirs, I ſhall not hold you much longer, for I will onely ſay this to you, that in truth I could have deſired ſome little time longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would have put this that I have ſaid in a little more order, and a little better digeſted than I have done, and therefore I hope you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me.</p>
                           <p>I have delivered my Conſcience, I pray God that you doe take thoſe courſes that are beſt for the good of the Kingdom, and your own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     <q>I thank you very heartily (my Lord) for that I had almoſt forgotten it. Introth Sirs, My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in Religion I think is very well known to all the world, and therefore I declare before you
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:66116:104"/>all, That I die a Chriſtian, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as I found it left me by my Father, and this honeſt man
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pointing to Dr.</hi> Jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> I think will witneſs it. <hi>Then turning to the Officers ſaid,</hi> Sirs, excuſe me for this ſame, I have a good cauſe, and I have a gracious God, I will ſay no more. <hi>Then turning to Colonel</hi> Hacker, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> Take care they doe not put me to pain, and Sir, this, and it pleaſe you. <hi>But then a Gentleman coming near the Ax, the King ſaid,</hi> Take heed of the Ax, pray take heed of the Ax. <hi>Then the King ſpeaking to the Executioner, ſaid,</hi> I ſhall ſay but very ſhort Prayers, and when I thruſt out my hands—</q>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then the King called to Doctor <hi>Juxon</hi> for his Night-cap, and having put it on, he ſaid to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, <hi>Does my hair trouble you?</hi> who deſired him to put it all under his Cap, which the King did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly by the help of the Executioner and the Biſhop: then the King turning to Doctor <hi>Juxon,</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have a good Cauſe, and a gracious God on my ſide.</hi>

                  <p>There is but one Stage more, this Stage is turbulent and troubleſome, it is a ſhort one: But you may conſider, it will ſoon carry you a very great way: it will carry you from Earth to Heaven; and there you ſhall find a great deal of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial joy and comfort.</p>

                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I goe from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown; where no diſturbance can be, no diſturbance in the world.</hi>

                  <p>You are exchanged from a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral to an Eternal Crown, a good exchange.</p>
                  <p>The King then ſaid to the Executioner, Is my hair well? Then the King took off his Cloak and his George, giving his George to Doctor <hi>Juxon,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66116:105"/>Remember (* <hi>It is thought for to give it to the Prince.</hi>) Then the King put off his Doublet, and being in his Waſtcoat, put his Cloak on again, then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Block, ſaid to the Executioner, <hi>You muſt ſet it faſt.</hi>
                  </p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Executioner.</speaker>
                  <p>It is faſt, Sir.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When I put my hands out this way, ſtretching them out, them</hi>—</p>
               </sp>
               <p>After that, having ſaid two or three words (as he ſtood) to himſelf, with hands and eyes lift up; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtooping down, laid his Neck upon the Block: and then the Executioner again putting his hair under his Cap, the King ſaid (thinking he had been going to ſtrike) Stay for the ſign.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Executioner.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I will and it pleaſe your Majeſty.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>And after a very little pauſe, the King ſtretching forth his hands, the Executioner at one blow ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his head from his body: The head being off, the Executioner held it up, and ſhewed it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which done, it was with the Body put in a Coffin covered with black Velvet for that purpoſe, and conveyed into his Lodgings there: And from thence it was carried to his houſe at Saint <hi>James</hi>'s, where his body was embalmed and put in a Coffin of Lead, laid there a fortninght to be ſeen by the people; and on the Wedneſday ſevennight after, his Corps embalmed and coffined in Lead, was delivered chiefly to the care of four of his Servants, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> Captain <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> his Sewers, Captain <hi>Preſton,</hi> and <hi>John Joyner,</hi> former Cook to his Majeſty; they attended with others, cloathed in Mourning Suits and Cloaks, accompanied the Herſe that night to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and placed it in that which was formerly the Kings Bed-chamber; next day it was removed into the <hi>Deans Hall,</hi> which Room was hanged with black, and made dark;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66116:105"/>Lights burning round the Herſe, in which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till Three in the Afternoon, about which time came the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lyndſey,</hi> having obtained an order from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the decent Interment of the King their Royal Maſter, provided the expence thereof exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not five hundred pounds: At their coming into the Caſtle, they ſhewed their Order of Parliament to Collonel <hi>Wichcot</hi> Governour of the Caſtle, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Interment might be in St. <hi>Georges</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and by the Form in the Common-Prayer Book of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> this requeſt was by the Governour denyed, ſaying, It was improbable that the Parliament would permit the uſe of what they had ſo ſolemnly aboliſhed, and therein deſtroy their own Act. To which the Lords replyed, There is a difference betwixt deſtroying their own Act, and diſpenſing with it, and that no Power ſo binds its own hands, as to diſable it ſelf in ſome caſes: All could not prevail, the Governour perſiſting in the Negative, the Lords betook themſelves to the ſearch of a convenient place for the Burial of the Corps; the which after ſome pains taking therein, they diſcover a Vault in the middle of the Quire, wherein, as is probably conjectured, lyeth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and his beloved Wife the Lady <hi>Jane Seamor,</hi> both in Coffins of Lead; in this Vault, there being Room for one more, they reſolve to inter the body of the King, the which was accordingly brought to the place, born by the Officers of the Garriſon, the four Corners of the Velvet Pall born up by the aforeſaid four Lords, the pious Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> following next, and other Perſons of Quality; the Body was committed to the earth with ſighs and tears, eſpecially of the Reverend
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66116:106"/>Biſhop, to be denyed to do the laſt Duty and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his Dear and Royal Maſter; the Velvet Pall being caſt into the Vault was laid over the Body, upon the Coffin was theſe words ſet, <q>KING CHARLES 1648.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the <hi>Regicides</hi> had committed this Horrid and nefarious Act, the prevailing Power conſiſting of a patcht number of the Houſe of Commons, and the chief Officers of the Army, combined together, and ſeeing how ſucceſsfully and unoppoſed they had effected this ſo unparalel'd a Deed, to which they knew the generality of the Nation were utterly averſe, and as far as they durſt, ſhew'd their abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; They in the next place fall upon the alteration of the Government, thinking to make ſure work by ſubverting the Ancient Monarchy of this Realm, and inſtead thereof introducing that which they called a <hi>Free State, or Common-wealth.</hi> For conſtituting of which the firſt thing they did, was to Vote and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh by Proclamation, <hi>That whereas ſeveral pretences might be made to the Crown,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the apparent hazard of the publick Peace, no Perſon whatſoever ſhould preſume to proclaim or any way promote</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>Son of the ſaid</hi> Charles <hi>late King of</hi> England, <hi>or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be King or chief Magiſtrate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by colour of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, or any other claim whatſoever, without the free Conſent of the People in</hi> Parliament; firſt <hi>ſignified by a particular Act for that purpoſe, any Law or Cuſtom to the contrary notwithſtanding; and whoſoever ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Order proclaim,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be adjudged a Traytor, and ſuffer accordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This proceeding was founded upon a Maxim which they had taken up, and agreed on among themſelves, namely, <hi>That all Power and Authority is Originally in the People:</hi> But well knowing that their
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66116:106"/>Councils had ſoon been confounded, and themſelves interrupted in the courſe they had begun, if they had incorporated again with thoſe of their Members which had been forcibly kept out by the Army, they Reſolve and decree, 1. <hi>That all thoſe Members who had aſſented to the Vote of</hi> Decemb. 5. <hi>concerning the Kings Conceſſions</hi> (for that was the occaſion of their ſecluſion) <hi>ſhould never be readmitted, and that thoſe that Voted in the Negative, ſhould preſently enter their ſaid diſſent, or before they were to be admitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And together with the fortune of Monarchy was involved that of the <hi>Houſe of Peers,</hi> who having ſent to deſire a Conference about ſetling the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in regard the Judges Commiſſions were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Kings Death, inſtead of an Anſwer to their Meſſage, the <hi>Junto</hi> of the Commons upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Voted, the Lords Houſe to be <hi>uſeleſs and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> and therefore to be laid aſide, as in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they declared the Kingly Office to be <hi>unneceſſary</hi> and <hi>Burthenſom,</hi> and therefore fit to be aboliſhed; only they allowed the Lords the Priviledge of being capable to be choſen Burgeſſes into the Houſe of Commons; But the Lords were ſo highly incenſed thereat, that there was ſuddenly publiſhed a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the name of all the Peers and Barons of the Realm, wherein they proteſt againſt the Proceedings of the Commons. And a while after ſome of the Kings friends in deſpite of all Votes, Acts, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the contrary, promoted a Proclamation, in the name of all the Nobility, Gentry, and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Kingdom, for proclaiming <hi>Charles</hi> our preſent Soveraign to be King of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But little could unarmed Declarations prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the reigning Power of an Armed faction, who now aſſumed new Enſigns of Soveraignty, cancelling the Old, and cauſed all Writs, Commiſſions, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66116:107"/>Inſtruments of publick Concernment, to be iſſued out under a new Stile and Teſt, that is of, <hi>The Keepers of the Liberties of</hi> England <hi>by Authority of Parliament.</hi> They ordered the old Great Seal to be broken, and a new one to be made, with the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> on one ſide, and this Inſcription, <hi>The Great Seal of</hi> England; and on the other ſide the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons with this Inſcription, <hi>In the firſt Year of Freedom by Gods bleſſing reſtored,</hi> 1648. and appointed the Money to bear the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with this <hi>Motto, God with us;</hi> and the Great Seal was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with three Commiſſioners: They likewiſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Kings Arms to be pulled down every where, and the Kings Picture in the <hi>Old Exchange</hi> they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be defaced, and the following Inſcription to be be ſet behind it in Golden Letters: <q xml:lang="lat">
                     <hi>Exit Tyrannus Regum ultimus, Anno Libertatis Angliae Reſtitutae Primo, Anno</hi> 1648. <hi>Jan.</hi> 30.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They next proceed to erect another Illegal High Court of Juſtice, wherein they brought to Tryall D. <hi>Hamilton</hi> taken at the fight at <hi>Preſton,</hi> the E. of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at <hi>Kingſton</hi> Fight, and the L. <hi>Capell</hi> and L. <hi>Goring</hi> taken at the Seige of <hi>Colcheſter;</hi> The three firſt were Condemned and beheaded at the <hi>Palace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> After this the L. <hi>Fairfax</hi> having laid down his Commiſſion, the Parliament made <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> their General, who a while after was ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he proved very ſucceſsfull.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty was now in <hi>France,</hi> and hoped to get aid there, but found none; but the <hi>Junto</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make Sale of the King and Queens Lands, and made a formal Act for aboliſhing Kingly Government and diſinheriting the Roval Iſſue, and ſeting up a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick or Free State;</hi> This Act Alderman <hi>Reynardſon</hi> was commanded to proclaim in the City, which he refuſing, was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> with three Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66116:107"/>more; and a new Lord Maior was choſen by a <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> who attended with ſeveral other Aldermen as complyant as himſelf, readily obeyed the Commands of his Maſters, and proclaimed their Edict in ſeveral places of the City.</p>
               <p>A while after, His Majeſty was ſolemnly Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and after great debate among them there, they at length agree on ſome Propoſitions to be ſent to the King, who was then in the Iſle of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Windram</hi> Laird of <hi>Libberton</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Meſſenger; who bringing them to the King, they were ſtiffly debated on each ſide; but at laſt <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> was appointed for the place of a Solemn Treaty, where Commiſſioners from the Eſtates and Kirk met the King, and delivered their Propoſitions: During which Treaty, the Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs</hi> was ſeized in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for oppoſing the Kirk Party, was condemned and Executed upon a Gibbet near fifty foot high, with all imaginable Contempt; which His Majeſty having an Account of, was much troubled, and the Treaty had like to have been broken off, but at length through the neceſſity of Affairs was concluded, and being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> after much debate it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, another Meſſage ſhould be ſent to invite the King over; but the Parliament here in <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of all theſe Proceedings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared an Army thereupon to invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the command of their General <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time General <hi>Blake</hi> their Admiral, took, ſunk and burnt moſt of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Fleet, which was a great damage to the Kings Affairs. And now the King being arrived at <hi>Spey</hi> in the North of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſome Lords were ſent down to accompany him to <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> As he came along he was entertained with the general Joy of all the People, and at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> he was preſented with 1500 Pounds, which thing was
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66116:108"/>ill taken by the <hi>Committee of Eſtates,</hi> and <hi>Kirk;</hi> and therefore they ſent an Injunction to prohibit other Places from doing the like; The King being now come to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> was again Proclaimed King, <hi>July</hi> 15. 1650. but his Coronation was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by reaſon of the then Troubles, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army was upon the Borders, and the <hi>Scots</hi> now began to think how to defend themſelves, and therefore marched under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Montgomery</hi> and ſet upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> but were worſted by them, and at <hi>Dunbar</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wholly routed them, taking the paſs there.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the <hi>Scots</hi> were divided among themſelves into three Parties, but the King returning with <hi>Montgomery</hi> to St. <hi>Johnſtons</hi> they were all reconciled, and the King on <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. 1650. was Crowned at <hi>Scone;</hi> and ſoon after ſet up his Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> reſolving to be himſelf <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army; About which time Sir <hi>Hen. Hyde</hi> was behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>London</hi> for his Loyalty; and not long after Captain <hi>Brown Buſhell</hi> received the like Doom, for performing ſome ſignall ſervices to the King; the King began to fortifie <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lang,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> drew near it: and <hi>Cromwell</hi> perceiving he could not draw the <hi>Scots</hi> to a Field Battel, ſuddenly tranſported over <hi>Fyfe</hi> 1600 foot, and four Troops of Horſe, who with the help of <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Okey,</hi> routed the <hi>Scots</hi> under Sir <hi>John Brown,</hi> taking him and ſeveral other Perſons of Quality Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, killing 2000 on the place, and taking about 120 Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; not long after Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> were Behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Tower-hill</hi> upon the diſcovery of a Plot in <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Parliament</hi> by the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King ſeeing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> prevail ſo faſt, thought it beſt to quit <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo Marched for <hi>England, July</hi> 30. 1651. which <hi>Cromwell</hi> obſerving, ſent <hi>Lambert</hi> after him with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Party of Horſe: The Kings Army being now in <hi>England,</hi> the Parliament cauſed numerous Forces to be raiſed in moſt Counties in <hi>England,</hi> and his Majeſty marched on to <hi>Worceſter</hi> and fortified it: In the mean time Maj. General <hi>Lambert</hi> gained the paſs at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton,</hi> by a deſperate attempt, in cauſſing ſome of his Troopers to ſwim the River on Horſeback, carrying their Piſtols and Holſters in their hands, to ſave them from wet: whereby they put Maj. Gen. <hi>Maſſey</hi> and his men to the Retreat, ſo that the Kings Party was forced to quit the Town, and leave the paſs to the Parliamentarians, who quickly made a Bridge over the River; and <hi>Cromwell</hi> joining with the reſt of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the King, after ſome Sallies out of the Town againſt them, at length the King in the Front of his men, ſallied out of Town on <hi>Sept.</hi> 3. 1651. and ſo valianty charged <hi>Cromwells</hi> Life-Guard, that they were forced to retire, till ſeconded by freſh Forces, they put the Kings Party to the Retreat; and the King had his Horſe twice ſhot under him, and not able to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66116:108"/>rally again, they were forced to fly into the Town, where <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells</hi> Party entered Pell Mell with them, and then the Cry went, <hi>Save the King, Save the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King ſeeing all loſt, with ſome of his Nobles and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, eſcaped with much difficulty to a Farmers houſe in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-ſhire,</hi> where he diſrobed himſelf, and for want of Sciſſers had his Hair out off with a Knife; and ſo with the Company of one Friend (who brought him Proviſion towards night) he betook himſelf to a Wood, where he made an Oak his Palace; the Souldiers hunting about for him, and a thouſand Pound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed as a Reward to thoſe that could take him; It is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there were about three thouſand ſlain at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred taken Priſoners, and not long after the E. of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> who was one of them, was Beheaded at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty through many dangers and difficulties arrived at laſt ſafely at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> And a while after <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, April</hi> 20. 1653.
